oDRzdTHRPIE,"I'd like to keep this channel strictly around property investment however so many people are asking me my opinion on corona the truth is I'm not really sure exactly what I think about it in terms of what a lot of the other guys are saying you can't ignore the fact that so many very rich people Robert Kiyosaki Grant Cardone even Elon Musk and people talking about the corona as if it's a little bit of a scam about the government adding it with an agenda there is no Kovach 19 it doesn't exist and now I've got governments regulators trillion-dollar Silicon Valley companies and basically every social media platform Under the Sun that have banned me they're coming after me they're coming after my company and coming after my reputation stop the [ __ ] media people you're blowing this up because you know full well one thing that the worst you make it look the more people will watch the news and right now and lock down to it we can't leave the house well you know number one you can go out it's it's interesting to me how many people are just so easily giving up on their freedom and just going into agreement with the regulations look how many people just said okay must stay in know almost no one's challenging it yeah I'm not staying in I mean I'm in my studio right now I think they said I'm not supposed to be here the police had been here like three times this week and I got a security guy that said yeah tell them mr. cardones inside I'll tell them he's not supposed to be here like like like I'm not going to give up on my freedom okay like I'm not going to give up on my ability to produce and to create I've gotten more covet emails man during this time and it all starts off the same way during Coe bid 19 I hope your family's well dude I didn't I'm not reading your email because I need you to wish good stuff for my family what can you do for me how can you help me how can we make money together yeah but then you say it's gonna be a little harder you have to speak to little people but then you also say we need to think bigger so well yeah because if it's gonna be harder yeah bro there better be some gold down there and to get if the ground is harder to pick in there better something underneath that ground if the works harder the payoff ought to be bigger yeah and when the payoffs not big enough what happens is people quit sure see I'm confident this whole thing has got nothing to do with a virus I'm confident this is completely about wealth redistribution where we're going through the one of the biggest wealth redistributions in the history of mankind so what's not going to look like so what that means is that means people in the middle class are basically having money wealth taken from them yeah and it's getting redistributed yeah everybody in America gets a $1,200 check alright it looks like everybody in America is gonna get a $1,200 check but what happens is what happens once you get to 1200 most of those people are gonna go spend it on some stupid stuff mmm and this is what the wealthy know yeah give them all the money they want they're not gonna keep it there's no plan to keep it there's no plan for well there's no plan to invest you can't get money from me because I take my money I get rid of money and I buy a real property with it whack the people that were half committed if you were not 100 percent committed to your tasks like Elon Musk is Elon Musk ain't he he's not stopping anything yeah so this is almost going to draw a line into the sum between the people that are the real action takers the real hard work was the real commit people and those that are not really serious the people that have partial commitments just gave up the people that have 75 percent commitment most of them have given up I mean you have to have be obsessed or be average yeah you have to be completely insane in a good way but then they run you got to be this guy right here yeah ain't no buyers gonna stop him this is a net this is a manufactured Great Depression when there was real unemployment now they have to manufacture unemployment I mean it's more frightening than I ever imagined it's more dastardly as more deceptive it's more criminal than I ever imagined I'm not that I'm afraid but I feel for the people who were to the people who really think it's about the virus not the biggest cash highs going on behind their backs in the repo market the commercial paper market and the credit markets they just can't see their money is being stolen via their money I would love to know what you think about all this craziness listen I know how to make a lot of money in property I don't want to speak too much about the coronavirus I don't want my YouTube channel to get taken down like many other people's videos are getting taken down but what I do know is that they're printing a lot of money right now what I do know is that the rich are gonna get richer and the poor are gonna get poorer because this pandemic is going to create opportunities but it's also going to crush many many people do I think the government are doing it deliberately I'm not really exactly sure I want to know your thoughts comment your thoughts below I'm very very curious also the full interview with myself and Grant Cardone that's going to go live tomorrow we're not just going to be talking about coronavirus we're gonna be talking about how to thrive not just survive but thrive through 2020 if you want to see the full interview subscribe right here I'll see you real soon peace out god bless you comment your thoughts around this pandemic below lockdown Korona quarantine what do you think comment I'm very curious or with every comment ",3
2ACWWVuhwzc,"alright guys this video is the only video you'll ever need to see to show you how fatal coronavirus is compared to the flu as it stands right now this is the only one you have to watch this is the easiest and simplest proof and facts that show as hard as it is to believe you know what I'm gonna say it I'm gonna draw any conclusions I'm just going to let you just make those up for your mind because I'm just gonna present these facts to you and you're gonna see and you have no choice to accept what is in front of you even those that are just blinded and think CNN is the actual real news network that tells the truth and if you like Donald Trump done like a Donald Trump ad ain't gonna matter you did this proof in front of you is undeniable so this is what looking at death rates from coronavirus Cove in nineteen in the United States as of April 29th or April 9th 2020 by state for one or a thousand right so this time people are dying per 100,000 people right it's very simple it doesn't matter who cares what it is the higher the number the more people are dying that's all comes down to this is deaths rates for influenza pneumonia in Canada from 22,000 to 2017 there's the numbers this is the ones in America so you know what don't need Canada let's just do America to America America to America alright and this is the numbers right there death by influenza pneumonia in the u.s. from the 50s to 2017 there's the number per 100,000 there's exact one per 100,000 right we're all on board here and in here we have the whole world and they have desper 1 million so obviously we all know that there's 10 100 thousands in a million because 10 times 1 our thousand is 1 million and if you want to do that you just have divided by 10 so if 71 divided by 10 is 7.1 380 divided by 10 is 38 so we're all I mean 3 yeah 38 right we're all falling along as it stands right now in New York has the highest deaths per 1000 people from Cove in 1932 now before we go into that I also have to give you full information that you do it probably haven't known about from leaked information from the National Vital Statistics system of Stephen Schwartz director or a doctor to see the shores director of vital statistic National Center for Health Statistics in Toledo Rhode Island erode Toledo road rather in heights Maryland this is the system that keeps track of all the deaths or kovin 19 and in reports there's websites like this okay now one thing you need to know is that should covin 19 here at the bottom be reported on the death certificate only with a confirmed test follow down below here Cova 19 should report on the death certificate for all the descendants where the disease caused and this is the highlight you might want to pay attention to or is assumed to have caused or contributed to death you guys got that or is consumed assumed like no proof but we assume that it contributed to death so it's like might have maybe it didn't the recovery iron line to see if there's like chronic conditions like COPD or asthma they also contributed or cancer or heart disease or who knows what could have contributed to it but you know what if it's if you have any if you think it it did in any way whatsoever though proof without even any testing mark it as a death but you know what forget I even said that you know what who cares let's just roll with this this is this role that they you know that they converse inaccurate and everyone who dies oak over 19 was a perfectly healthy stud muffin like yours truly and I just died okay that just died I'll God still going to improve you wrong for those people that are trying to say that the media is right and Kovan 19 is so bad and oh my god the world's ending we need to give up our freedoms and lock everybody up and start ticketing people and force vaccinations we need enforce vaccinations and get IDs and check posts and you can't leave your house without your confirmed coronavirus vaccination certificate that you are a clean upstanding citizen and we need your microchipped as well we need to force vaccination and microchipped you 32 worst in the all of america right display influenza last year was fourteen point two right for what our thousands just look at the numbers 32 14 damn that's horrible right I mean but I need to look back down these over here at 98 stuff before I guess they had vaccinations right look how high they were back then there's no vaccinations but we have vaccinations now he thoughts well we didn't back here and the worst place in the world right now New York 32 but let's not even pay attention to the rest of America that is 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 4 5 7 and when you add all these up together and put it as one country oh my god this 32 also turns into like an average of all the rest which is probably like a seven like a six five I don't know maybe a four because 99% of America is down here you know besides one two three four states the other the other 50 states are all ones that are not even reporting it's don't inhabited only that's time in fifty four states I didn't attend all of America maybe another fifty four states in America I'm Canadian I could be wrong on that so don't hold it to me doesn't matter my geography is not the test here what the point is you have to see these numbers but my god yeah we have vaccines eight thoughts who care so you got fourteen point three bit vaccinated B vaccine against the flu but still fourteen point three appeal per hundred thousand died yeah well hey man I mean if you just take all of America right now it's seven point one because you know we got desperate 1 million population right in USA you have to divide that by ten you get 7.1 how about Spain 38:33 the worst in the world Spain's 38 so are they're on par with like you know when it was really bad back in the 90s 80s you know [ __ ] man 70s we didn't shut down the country then we didn't like take people's rights away we didn't force vaccinations we didn't stop people's movements we didn't have 24/7 news people of fear-mongering I mean look at Canada Canada's two point one I mean can that was twenty one ten times as high the death rate per 100,000 in Canada was 21 last June 2017 you guys saw that 21 I mean should I bring it up here I think I have in my history don't I there is it right there yeah there's Canada right there 20 last year in 2017 20 what's it now it's the same per 1 million I mean that you only year oh you're getting it takes you a million people in Canada right now to equate the same level as it did here and people wondering like my wife wonders why do you make these videos eight thoughts why do you care why do you keep making these videos why you're trying to show people the truth I mean five point five and Iran thirty three point seven in Belgium and like here's the thing too that doesn't make any sense right I mean why why is the question doesn't make any sense why because I feel as if the more people that know about this the more people are awake I feel it's my duty even though you get so many dislikes that so many people leaving comments down below and getting so mad and telling me to go die and I you know you're such a loser and it's so big deal you're just stupid eight thoughts stick to make up on a call the duty beauty and these feels let me get that many views I just feel it's my duty that people need to know the truth because always see something's going on here this isn't making sense I mean 14.3 there is no state in America outside of New York that is that is at that Louisiana these places here that's it are on par with the with the flu yeah he thought you know what though could be so much higher if we weren't doing social distancing well Sweden isn't doing social distancing at me but if you guys don't know that Sweden is not doing social distancing not at all one thing they're doing is they require asking people they're older than 70 or have health problems maybe you should stay at home and social isolator not go out that much and schools are open elementary schools are open high schools are open bars are open restaurants are open businesses are open telling people to take precautions be smart about it try not to hang out too much but you know carry on with your lives and businesses are gonna keep going they have 91 deaths per 1 million that would equal 9.1 without any social distancing where they go Sweden were Dell are they who the hell are they Sweden right there 9.1 right here right lower than influenza has ever shown in the history of America or Canada I just I have to make these videos guys because I can't stand in any like I said also keeping the consideration or is assumed to have caused or you know ARCA to to death come on folks um is going on I don't know what it is if you're into agenda21 and conspiracies of new world order and controlling people and destroying small businesses so bigger businesses can get have more power and people that I put this out on Twitter and I know a lot of you could understand that you're like hey thoughts how is this gonna make people richer well when the stock market crashes people sell or people are short stocks I can't go on an accountant explain to you what shorting stocks is just Google at what is short and stocks people short stocks which means you're basically betting that it's gonna collapse they can do that in the stock market you're betting that the stock market's going to go down and you can make them a bunch of money what you do is this a simple explanation is if you have a lot of cash people are selling stocks because they rely on that for like their to pay bills they rely on it to like you know for interest rates and somebody then they start to panic and they sell well the rich buy it and then what inevitably inevitably the stock will go up again when everything settles and the rebounding of the economy occurs and they will sell back to the people that now originally sold it or didn't sell it or people who have money in the middle class as it always happens that money starts going back in the middle class and the rich sell it back to them again at a huge profit also small businesses start to get destroyed in the bigger businesses takeover like the you know the Walmart's the moment pop shops are gone the amazon's government the government corporate government run organizations also get contracts for all kinds of things with viruses with medical supplies who knows but I don't know guys might want to wake up to this you can't lie you can't deny these members there's this is right in front of you this is right in front of you it's right there one two three four come on seriously besides America I mean New York rather the rest of the country is below that that's per 100,000 in compared to Canada and below on average America expects you back in the 90s and what another four they had all these vaccines coming in for the whole people mostly Jesus all right also on top of that most bill dying from covert are all old this is all old people 99% old or people who are [ __ ] up to begin with all right I got to spread truth I can't stop myself I just I hate liars and I hate misinformation and I hate agendas and I don't trust the government and I don't trust you Andy's medical establishments because the stats show us we shouldn't trust them so I'm gonna keep making the videos that's it by ",2

gnQL-brI-9I,"The spread of the coronavirus The spread of a deadly new virus How deadly is it, how fast can it spread, and how prepared are we As experts fear it could become a pandemic It can lead to organ failure, pneumonia and death. There's no treatment, so prevention is a top priority. The recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus now called COVID-19 has left many of us worried and paranoid about our own health, as well as interacting with other people in carrying out everyday tasks such as traveling on public transport. At the time of film in this video, the number of people diagnosed with the virus worldwide is nearing a hundred thousand and the number of people who have died is currently over two thousand, and is set to continue rising. Fears are growing that it won't be possible to stop the global spread of coronavirus. Health experts have warned that the chances of containing it are diminishing as cases appear in more countries. This means that COVID-19 is overtaking the SARS and MERS viruses in regards to the number of people killed and also infected. This video isn't about coronavirus. This is about something much worse, something that you may have never even heard of. Something the experts have predicted will kill 10 million people each year by 2050. To put that into perspective the World Health Organization has stated that cancer killed an estimated 9.6 million people in 2018. The risk is so urgent that a recent United Nations report claimed that common diseases are becoming untreatable and the World Health Organization has described it as one of the biggest threats to global health. The risk is antibiotic resistance - a problem that occurs when bacteria adapt, gradually causing antibiotics to become less and less effective until we are left with diseases that we are unable to treat. If we can't get this under control by 2050 not long, the worldwide toll will be 10 million deaths a year. Currently around 700,000 people around the world die due to antibiotic resistant diseases every single year, with over 200,000 of those deaths coming from a drug-resistant tuberculosis, yet even though the number of people being killed right now by antibiotic resistance dwarves the number of people at risk from COVID-19, many of us have never heard about this problem. The problem is becoming so severe that issues like urinary tract infections and STDs are becoming resistant to treatment. There is even a super resistant strain of gonorrhea which has developed resistance to nearly all of the antibiotics used for its treatments. A world without usable antibiotics is a world where the diseases and infections that we currently regard as being trivial could become deadly. Illnesses like pneumonia could kill tens of millions of people, as could sepsis. Organ transplants will be extremely dangerous, and cancer fighting chemotherapy will be severely affected, as antibiotics are needed to fight off infection as chemotherapy destroys our white blood cells. Even procedures like hip and knee replacements and dental work could become dangerous, and even life-threatening. The so-called miracle of modern medicine would cease to exist and our healthcare systems would regress to the state they were in in the early 20th century. So why is this happening? Well firstly because doctors and medical professionals are handing out too many antibiotics, leading to calls for them only to be given out when they absolutely have to be. An even bigger and more widespread problem is related to the food that we eat. According to the FDA in the US, 80 percent of all antibiotics sold are used on animal farms, and in Europe animals consume more antibiotics than humans, meaning that the use of antibiotics in animal farming is driving the rise of resistant bacteria. Our conservation of animal products is creating one of the biggest threats to human health on our planet right now due to the fact that we raise animals in such a horrific way that they require antibiotics to keep them alive just long enough that we can then cut their throats or kill them in a gas chamber and then eat them. On much of the planet, most meat animals get antibiotics every day of their lives not to cure illnesses but to fatten them up and to protect them against the factory farm conditions they are raised in. It is such an absurd system that is not only responsible for killing trillions of animals every year, but is leading the way in creating a global health crisis that within the next few decades could be killing more humans than cancer every year. It is also worth mentioning that the new coronavirus (COVID-19) is reported as starting in an animal market where wild animals and live animals are traded as well, meaning that again, in the same way as outbreaks have been caused in the past, our exploitation of non-human animals has created the new coronavirus outbreak. Killing non-human animals is in turn killing us as well and even if we create new antibiotics in the future this cycle of bacteria becoming resistant will continue if we don't change. To make matters worse, pharmaceutical companies are currently infecting animals with COVID-19 in the hope of finding a way to create a vaccination. And so because of our desire to kill and eat animals, more animals now have to suffer. How can it make sense? The most important medication that we have in the world is being squandered. Keeping animals alive just long enough so that we can fatten them up, slaughter them, and then eat them, in turn causing our leading diseases such as heart disease and certain forms of cancer. Everybody suffers when we exploit others. Is this an absurdity that we will recognize and prevent from getting worse, or will we continue to turn a blind eye and then in the future look at our children and tell them that we're sorry, but bacon just tasted too good.

YRqEscW7IPw,ever since the corona virus pandemic caused travel restrictions lockdowns and economic downturns around the world it was being expected that this pandemic will give way to a new world order China is being accused of causing the pandemic by mishandling the covert 19 outbreak and covering up its severity the Chinese regime did so with the help of its authoritarian regime where the voices of doctors and citizen journalists were muzzled it did so with its deep influence in the w-h-o which helped Bluff the world and now it has resorted to acts of aggression in the time of the pandemic be here in Hong Kong the South China Sea or the border with India now China is facing serious backlash from every direction and there is an increasing sentiments to hold the CCP regime accountable Beijing fears a shake-up in the global equations and its fears have come true as Donald Trump has proposed to expand the g7 by inviting Russia India South Korea and Australia to join the group of most advanced economies this is a clear sign of the new world order which is here as the expanded g7 consisting of g7 countries and India South Korea and Australia the three countries have reportedly accepted Trump's invitation the extended group is likely to meet in September to discuss China's future this comes days after Trump called for the expansion of the quote-unquote very outdated group and said that the meet would now be held in September November India Russia South Korea and Australia should also be invited the president has said that countries like India Australia South Korea and Russia should also get representation in the grouping and it should be called the g10 or g11 Trump said I'm postponing it because I don't feel that as a g7 it probably represents what is going on in the world only Russia seems unlikely to join the expanded g7 because the suggestion of bringing Russia into the extended fall hasn't gone down well within group of world's most advanced economies the UK and Canada have opposed Trump's invites to Russia Russia was excluded from this group earlier called the g8 and response to his invasion of Crimea moreover Beijing and Moscow have been showing a sense of camaraderie admits the ongoing pandemic and it doesn't sound reasonable for Putin to join a group that is clearly aimed against China however in the case of a triangular world order where the US Russia and China from the three different polls anything is possible above this earlier it was reported that the UK was planning to propose a d-10 alliance of 10 democracies including India to counter Chinese CCP backed 5g giant Huawei the prospect of an expanded g7 coming together has riled up China and Beijing has been castigating countries on this latest development Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Chao Li John has said China believes all international organizations and conferences should be conducive to mutual trust between countries - holding multilateralism promoting world peace and development he added that we believe this is a role of the overwhelming majority of the countries in the world any attempts to seek small circle against China is doomed to fail and is unpopular clearly the expansion of the g7 with an eye on Beijing hasn't gone down well with China China knows that this group of high-income countries can hurt it like never before these countries can easily use their economic prowess to keep China out of the supply chains and harass its exports based economy moreover within the g10 or the expanded g7 smaller groupings like the quad consisting of India Japan Australia and the United States could come together to further bolster their Indo Pacific strategy of isolating China and strategically crucial maritime region all countries in expanded g7 except India are high-income developed economies but that doesn't in I mean that new delhi's roar will get undermined in fact the whole strategy to reduce dependence on China and to counter its expansionism is centered around India Trump has included India within the expenditures seven keeping in mind that the country would play a big role in replacing China as a premier investment destination and a manufacturing hub for the company is based in the developed world and there may be a developing economy but it is at the center of this expanded intergovernmental economic organizations strategy to approach China's hegemony and welcome a new post coronavirus world order in which China's row will get watered down drastically you ,2
n-N5jcUEDGA,"[Music] welcome back to the heat is there a power structure in place in Washington that operates like a shadow government what some refer to as the deep state joining me now here in the studio is Frank H Buckley he is an author media contributor and professor at George Mason University Law School he's the author of the book the way back and joining us from California is Eric great sir he is a geopolitical analyst and he's the host of counterpunch radio welcome to both of you to the show thank you for having me let's start out in California with Eric and Eric you just heard what Mike Bluffton had to say about the deep state he's done a lot of work on this he's worked at Congress he's seen it firsthand what did you make of what he said well I think there's a tremendous amount of truth in what Mike was saying and I think that he is quite correct to point out that essentially the deep state should be understood is more or less an interlocking system wherein government agencies and apparatus within those government agencies and those in the private sector those within the military-industrial complex and so forth that that essentially works towards a common agenda a common set of goals although it is not something that is necessarily conscious and it's not something that is necessarily planned out in a monolithic sort of way and I think that one of the points that was being stressed and I think it's critical to note is that the deep state does not act in concert it's not a monolithic entity it's not a differentiated cabal but rather it is a series of factions many of whom are at each other's throats right now and I think that Trump has in many ways brought that into stark relief and that's one of the most critical contributions to the discourse thus far namely that the deep state is not one single entity but that it is in many ways the manifestation or the architecture of the ruling establishment within the state apparatus Frank what are your views well I think it's helpful to remind people that we're talking about not one single thing about 27 different things and the question is do they add up to one single thing and I think I think I'd say not there are many different things going on things we should like to correct and things that are hard correct I mean for starters I think it's useful to distinguish between private groups out there that are trying to influence politics and and then the the regulators the administrators and in government as for the private groups out there look I get emails every day from these guys you know as you noted they're not trying to cover up their publicizing their stuff as best they can there's nothing like even close to a conspiracy instead you have different contested groups I think it's more helpful to push them off the table and to talk about about the bureaucrats in Washington who are I think systematically in favor of government surprise I mean it's government that hires them and therefore systematically opposed to administrations I'd want to shrink the size of the state drain the swamp as it were and and that really that's something one lives with basically it ascends to a problem when you talk about people like general Flynn that's a special kind of issue but is it necessary then for these groups to have relevance to have a function that this country be constantly in a state of tension with other countries around the world and to be at war with other countries around the world well that's a separate issue and it's one where hopefully the president administration will roll back some of those efforts at war I thought Trump hope I hoped Trump was the peace candidate I must say we'll see how that turns out but it certainly was the case that he didn't believe in foreign adventuresome his foreign policy speech was one which talked precisely about the opposite every given what we know are you in any way surprised that there isn't more outrage about what we're hearing right now there isn't more calls for accountability on the part of the public on the part of those people who have vote these politicians into power well to some degree I think there is and I think that's manifested in some of the media coverage in particular some of the major corporate media outlets in the United States that have been giving some play to a lot of these issues but I think that there's also another important facet to this and it's I guess in response to the previous comments there are namely that this separation between the private sector the private institutions and the government institutions I think is to some degree at least artificial because as we know there is a revolving door between the US government and the private sector whether it's Wall Street in finance capital or military contractors mercenary companies or a big oil big agribusiness or what have you so a lot of what we are calling here the deep state is in many ways the fluctuation the ebb and flow between these various facets of power in the United States and in many ways it is a somewhat permeable delineation between those two and I think that that's part of what we're seeing here because as Trump is able to posture as a populist and isolationist and anti interventionist and so forth during the campaign he's still very much embedded with private contractors with those who benefit from military contracts he's out there publicly today talking about raising the the military budget some ten percent or fifty four billion dollars many elements within the deep state are billing to benefit significantly from many of the policies that Trump is putting forward and that's why I would certainly reject the storyline or the narrative that somehow the deep state is at war with Trump I think rather the Trump administration this incoming administration or the administration we see now is a battlefield within which the elements in the deep state are fighting it out what do you think Frank is there or at least is the president the target of the deef stay more I listen to this some more I think the term the deep state should be banished from the language but I will say there you know there are elements of a problem that need to be addressed for what for example one thing I think I became clear in the last election round is money does not buy votes much in politics I mean Hillary outspent from two to one you know much good it did her on the other hand when people talk about the influence of lobbyists in Washington there I'm on their side I mean at this point it looks as if Congress is something of a farm team for K Street you leave Congress and 50% of the ex-congressman take a job as a lobbyist that's how you get a thousand-page bills with 20,000 pages of regulation attached we can't stop lobbyists from talking to congressman we don't want to but we don't want or shouldn't want to see lobbyists contributing money to politicians there is one view that right after the election I mean I think we could say that there was a state of shock in the country when Donald Trump was elected and straight after that those forces that strongly supported Hillary Clinton and the others made a concerted effort to undermine the guy who was just was just one yeah and much of that is just so you know what happens in a free society I mean I pick up the Washington Post every day and there are two stories in the front page about how terribly is in the Metro section and the Style section and even the sports section for gosh sakes but that's fine one has a free press and and they're able to do that the greater concern I suppose is not merely bureaucrats who will oppose the Trump agenda and one lives with that but the extent to which one fears that improper or you uses are made of their knowledge to destabilize your presidency and of that I you know I mean I have problems with what happened to Mike Flynn but apart from that it's going to be a matter of some house climbing by by people like general like Rex Tillerson right Eric that's a point I mean could we see this actually being counterproductive for what we might call the Greek the the deep state I mean what if as this administration beds down as it finds its feet it starts a major purge of these organizations and replaces all those people in upper management middle management with its own people well to some extent that's that's politics I'll get to you in a moment is gonna get that from Eric it's fine go ahead Eric well I I do think I do think that there is an element of that that's part of what we've seen certainly with some of the personnel changes in the State Department is one example but in a number of other government agencies as well so there is an element of that happening now but of course the danger is well really twofold on the one hand eliminating many of the operators and so you know let's call them technicians of the bureaucracy of the US government thereby making it even more dysfunctional and on the other hand of course creating such a furor within those institutions that it undermines and destabilizes the government itself and so I think that Trump is really playing rather dangerous game if he moves forward with a full purge and I think that that's part of the reason why you're seeing Trump backing away from a lot of these positions and really becoming more amenable to the political geopolitical and strategic agenda of the US government as it has been to this point okay Frankie what did he say well I think the main reason why he's not going to go through a major purge is because these people have tenure and and you can't just go around doing that but you know in many cases one would hope to see that there would be a change in the administration for just trivial example let's say the National Endowment for the Arts for example I mean presumably the president would like to have his own team in there this is why there are political appointees who will tell the bureaucrats the permanent folks what to do ditto in the State Department that's really how it's supposed to run I don't see a problem with that and this is not a new phenomenon and we saw it during the Hoover era didn't we oh yeah right well you know it's funny when you talk when you think about that I mean if there is such a thing as a bad old deep state that would it misbehave well in one case it might be revealing information in the other case it might be not revealing information right and there seem to be a lot of cases of strategic non-disclosure involving say John Kennedy we're gonna have to leave it there gentlemen thanks to both of you for joining us ",1
"vk8V4kOugyc,",as the Russia plot thickens the deep state is going mainstream right tonight we start with proof the deep state is real in America and that you the American people see what is really going on it's about a deep state trying to drag a crook across the presidential finish line and trying to destroy the man Americans wanted in the Oval Office wants the preserve of conspiracy theorists now the President of the United States calls himself a victim of it unelected deep-set operatives who defy the voters to push their own secret agendas are truly a threat to democracy itself for believers the deep state is a mysterious faction of opposition bureaucrats in Trump's case a shadowy cabal of Obama supporters entrenched in government intent on bringing him down a belief firmly held by Corey Lewandowski Trump's former campaign manager he had a phone conversation with Teresa May that phone conversation transpired in Air Force One I believe Air Force One has a secure line of communication particularly when he's having a conversation with a world leader do you think leaks are evidence of the deep state but no less than of course no less than 30 minutes after hanging up that phone call the media was reporting on the conversation that transpired that should be an issue security CERN that the President of the United States is creating conflict with an old ally isn't that the reason these things are coming out because it's behavior it's troubling a lot of people those are classified conversations and the leaking of classified information is punishable by putting people in prison you're Mike good morning I'm going to let people know I'm a true conservative right wing media sees Robert Mueller's investigation into possible collusion with Russia as the deep state in action before its conclusion Trump's supporters have already made up their minds stance freedom across the world if the deep state has a hand in the Russia investigation then you should be deeply suspicious of its conclusions if any investigation is biased by the Preferences of the people who arranged it you should be deeply skeptical of its conclusions accused architects of the deep state say Trump is using the idea to deflect all criticism former CIA Chief Michael Hayden insists that countering Trump on issues like his travel ban does not equal deep state it shouldn't have come as a surprise but it was a bad idea it made us less safe if you want to call pushing back against that evidence of the deep state go ahead but I come back to my view career professionals governed by the rule of law trying to do the right thing for the country what concerns you what keeps you up at night my grade is concerned that the most destabilizing force in the world today is the United States of America and we appear to be erratic and we appear to be moving back away from the key tenets of our foreign and security policy are you worried of course I'm worried Trump has worked hard to delegitimize the Russia investigation that could come to define his presidency if unfavorable he'll likely do the same with Robert mullahs findings but blaming the deep state will only get him so far Amanda Walker Sky News Washington ,1
b07eafPe7pY,[Music] this is China what is still the world's foremost industrial economy has apparently been knocked down a peg or two as it's emerged into the new decade there has been wild speculation about companies divesting from the country as a response to the critical flaws and supply chains that have been brought to light because of this crisis the world today is heavily reliant on China to manufacture almost everything that we take for granted in our modern lives what is more is that even if something isn't actually assembled in China it is extremely likely that there are at least some components of the final product that are this has alternate Li come about because China is incredibly cheap and easy as a source of low to medium level manufacturing but if hypothetically the whole system was to shut down even if it was only for a month well that can cause issues very very quickly and shatter the delicate supply chains of the world's mega corporations now we are not here to explore China or supply chains or even manufacturing for that matter we have already made videos that go over all of these individuals in much much more detail but what does need to be addressed is the idea that this crisis will be the ultimate downfall of China as an economic superpower reports of companies desperately looking for supply chain alternatives and speculation about countries that are going to move in to take their place have been all over the news and perhaps there is some merit to this speculation but a lot of this may be ungrounded in genuine economics and rather just be the product of things that people want to be true if we actually take a look at the global economy and a position of nations like China within it we will see that through things like debt based diplomacy and an economy first mentality they are potentially going to be the big winners in all of this something that must be addressed instantly as that this virus is no longer an issue that is specific to one country it is now a global issue so it's not as if one country is going to lose ground to anyone else because of lockdowns or anything of that nature specific to them it's ultimately dependent on who is in the best economic position now this means that it in a morbid kind of way all the major super powers of the world are kind of on an even footing with this one calls first supply chain redundancies that avoid countries like China would be pretty much ineffective in situations like this because there aren't really any countries that haven't been negatively affected at this point beyond that companies are ultimately institutions driven by short-term profit CEOs and investors are going to develop supply chains that are going to produce the most cost-effective goods that will give them the highest profit margins situations like this are not accounted for because it does not make good economic sense to do so let's take two companies as an example the first company is your generic risk-taking multinational their share price is really only as good as their most recent earnings report and they're charismatic CEO is driven primarily by year-on-year profits it does not make any sense for this company to produce their product anywhere else but China China has cheap manufacturing it is close to component suppliers and they have a decent reputation for getting things done on time by getting everything done in one place the company also only has to operate a single factory with a fixed overhead it only needs to navigate around one set of laws it can ship everything from a single location and it can adapt quickly if a new product needs to be rolled out the second company though is a risk-averse hypothetical they see all this chaos and decide that they don't want to put all of their eggs in a single manufacturing basket so they set up different factories all over the world well they kind of lose out big time here they have to pay to maintain multiple facilities they have to work with multiple component supplies work around multiple national laws it becomes a nightmare of logistics but more importantly it's expensive there is no conceivable way that this risk-averse company would be able to produce items as most effectively as the normal company which means that they would be run out of business during the good times and even in a situation like we find ourselves in today they wouldn't be any better off so a lot of talk about companies looking for redundant supply chains was either middle management spiel or Hughley unfactual at worse but of course you may correctly point out that there are many companies that have multiple production facilities producing the same product all over the world what is going on here well what is going on here is trade restrictions sometimes is cheaper for a company to set up a factory and build products domestically than these for them to pay import taxes for all of their products this is most common with more expensive goods like cars it's why companies like BMW and Toyota have factories in Germany and Japan as well as China the United States and Mexico the battle between protectionist policies that favor local industries and supporting free trade is a back and forth struggle that was happening before the outbreak and will be going on well after it has finished it may exacerbate the us-china trade war but we will get back to that soon the only difference between countries like the USA Japan the nations of the EU and China is that the Chinese government has a lot more direct control over their economy they can and do manage their exchange rate they support their state-owned companies directly with public funds and even internally what they say goes if they say tomorrow that everyone gets back to work everyone goes back to work and while this isn't particularly liberating or conducive to a totally free society it does mean that they can enact vital change a lot faster than other economies during times like this if there is anything that is going to slow China down is curiously enough that they are getting too rich country's all tend to grow in relatively similar ways they start off by farming and then quickly they develop manufacturing and this drives them towards becoming a developed economy with a domestic market of cashed-up consumers the thing we're changing from farming to manufacturing is that workers and manufacturing roles can create more value and all other things being equal earn more money when people earn more money they can spend more money which means local businesses have more money and on non until wages rise everywhere this sounds great but it can lead to a scary phenomenon known as the middle income trap when workers in a society demand higher wages it can make the country less competitive as a global supplier sure there are advantages to building phones in China or setting up call centers in the Philippines but let's face it the biggest driver is the enormous pool of cheap labour to outsource all of that work to if a country loses this cheap labour they lose their competitiveness this all gets worse when the country is not quite yet rich enough to facilitate developed domestic economy like most wealthy first world nations do today hence they are stuck in this middle income trap South Africa and Brazil are great examples of this going terribly terribly wrong they are no longer cheap enough to be great manufacturing or outsourcing centers but they aren't rich enough to be self-sufficient markets just yet now China has kind of seen this coming for years and it has done a few things to prepare for this for starters it still has a lot of poor people yippy it also has a critical mass of manufacturing with lacks laws around environment or workers rights and this means it's sure manufacturing is still going to be very very cheap there despite not necessarily being the cheapest labor market in the world but perhaps most importantly it is investing into other countries to pick up where it left off China has been a major financier of infrastructure development in a wide portfolio of developing economies throughout Asia and Africa it has established ports and factories and modern farms in countries like Senegal Nigeria Pakistan and Zimbabwe which has been a great move for a few key reasons firstly it helps expand their influence in the same way that America has military bases all over the world China wants to flex its geopolitical muscles a bit too but perhaps more importantly than that it just makes good business sense China has invested billions of dollars into these countries through loans written by their state-owned banks but these go beyond just collecting interest if China was to loan the Government of Nigeria a billion dollars to build a new port they can put stipulations on that contract the big one has been this port must be constructed using a Chinese construction company which not only means that the money finds its way back into China but it also means that China's excess productive capacity is properly utilized you may have seen this imagery before these are Chinese ghost cities huge developments that could house hundreds of thousands of people brought about because China has just become too damn good at building things and kind of ran out of people that need to be housed now as far as investments go entire city's worth of real estate that would lay dormant because there is no one to live in them a pretty poor what has shown to be a better use of those resources is to actually use it in the country that needs them and collect their income from that instead this Chinese foreign direct investment has become more and more influential in recent years and it has culminated in mega projects like the built in road development that will directly link China politically and economically with dozens of its neighbors now things like the belt and road project deserve a video all of their own but why it's particularly important right now is that China is holding on to a lot of debt that is owed to them as a result of these projects a nice little added bonus of this is that it pushes the prevalence of World Trade denoted in Chinese currency which means that the currency may soon rival US dollars as a world reserve in the short term though these developing countries need to be exporting their goods in order to repay these debts that are noted in Chinese currency if these countries suddenly can't pay this debt back because as trade in the world economy has gone crazy well then China has the right to swoop in and take back what is owed to them in late 2000 and 19 China clem Mombasa port in Kenya this gave them a huge asset as well as effective control over the largest trading port in all of Africa and when a Chinese state-owned company claims the trading port guess who you are kind of forced into trading with yep that's right China the port of Mombasa was just one critical piece of infrastructure on the continent that fell into their hands due to debt concerns which goes to show a lot of these countries were on the verge of defaulting before the economic trade collapse if this carries on much longer it stands to reason that China will be able to snap up some increasingly valuable and influential pieces of real estate all over the continent and it will in turn have a center of industry that will provide wealth back to China without actually needing to produce anything in China now this is not necessarily evil in and of itself we have seen how the United States has benefited greatly off corporate empires that return wealth back to the United States for industry that has never happened inside the United States but the big difference here is that American companies tend to take equity risks rather than debt risks meaning that they own what they have invested in and if these investments go bad they are the ones who lose out but don't go away thinking that the USA is somehow an angel and all of this they're not but this whole process has a name it's called debt trap diplomacy which is where a rich country like China convinces a poor country like any given African nation to take on debt that they probably won't be able to pay back when they default no worries just take something from them that you now own and use that to strengthen the influence you hold over this nation by doing this China is effectively foreclosing on a new continent of cheap labour and natural resources and this global economic crisis is likely to just speed up the process so in the interest of fairness it is also important to explore the other side of the argument which is that China may just be in serious trouble at the best of times Chinese economic data is questionable and there is no reason to believe that their indicators during this crisis are any more reliable than their testing figures a massive reduction in emissions from the country is actually one of the best indicators we have of the equally massive reduction in industry the country has suffered this has led to what many are speculating are some very desperate moves by the government since the country is reopened the environmental laws the nation did have regarding emissions and pollution have been temporarily suspended this was on paper an attempt to stimulate industry because sometimes these regulations can be a burden on maximum output a factory that can burn through chemicals and pour out waste into local waterways is going to be able to produce more than a factory that has to adhere to some level of environmental decency so this may be a bit of a boost that these companies desperately need to get going again except it doesn't really work like that sure an individual factory giving the big middle finger to the atmosphere is going to work more efficiently but if every factory in a dense industrial area does this oftentimes the issues caused by poor air quality and water quality hurt the economy more than any slight advantage it would give them in manufacturing this gets a bit tinfoil Hattie but a fun little theory is that these lacks environmental policies are a bizarre way to save face given that government industrial output figures are so unreliable a lot of economists and institutions actually look at these emissions over the officially reported figures turning the coal burners on to eleven is a great way to bump up those emissions and give the impression that industry is going stronger than ever flaunting a poor side effect of a positive action it is literally the macroeconomic equivalent of some kid in the eighth grade giving themselves a hickey to show that they totally got it on to all their friends at school now look crazier things have been true but on a more realistic level nobody is going to deny that China is hurting from this it's an export economy that can export it's a manufacturing superpower that has nothing to manufacture it's the workshop of a world out of work their economy will fall into a recession but so will everybody else's global output is predicted to drop by over three percent this year and there is no reason to expect that they will be hit any harder than anybody else make no mistake we are living through history at the moment and trying times like this are roughest speculation about what the future may hold one of the big answers that everybody wants is what is going to become of the nation that is the logical starting point of this economic turmoil the idea that they are going to fall behind massively has a vindictive quality to it but the truth is it probably won't be the case we all know of people that use economic downturns like this to buy up cheap shares or real estate and it's likely that China with their huge foreign currency reserves and direct lending portfolio will be in a position to do the same thing but it will just buy up entire nations instead just because something feels right or because it's fair or even because it seems logical doesn't necessarily make it true introspectively we all have to admit that just a little bit we want the reports of a crippled China to be true but it doesn't mean that they are hi guys thanks for watching if you did enjoy please consider liking and

RU-Y9SnUEQE,so you're the heads of china once one of the greatest empires in the world but in the late 1800s and early 1900s you hit a rough patch [Music] china was defeated and pillaged by the british the french japan russia basically china an empire that very much values honor respect was put to shame on the world stage for over a hundred years it was so bad that china would later call it the century of humiliation if that wasn't bad enough china also had a few more rough patches after that with around 18 to 45 million deaths during a movement they called the great leap forward and around another 20 million deaths during the movement after that called the cultural revolution because of all the shame and disgrace you've grown to resent not just the west but the rest of the east the north the south and everyone in between you long for the days when you were number one when you were on top of the world but don't take my word for it take the word from all these chinese officials that regularly spout this china has become a global leader in terms of composite national strength and international influence and the worst part is that you could easily be number one if it wasn't for those milling americans that believe in democracy natural rights and other dangerous ideas like freedom of speech ideas that if your populist gets a whiff of it would be the end of your rule because of these ideas and the fact that america is the only one standing in your way for world domination this automatically makes them public enemy number one throughout human history all the way up to the 1900s to defeat an enemy state you simply go to war but as we've seen with our 100 years of shame traditional warfare hasn't been our strong suit for a while but it is for those despicable americans even though the americans didn't really win in the middle east or vietnam or korea their traditional forces of soldiers tanks and aircraft are a force to be reckoned with while having actual combat experience so you put your pride away and objectively realize that it's far from guaranteed that you could win a head-to-head boots on the ground war with the us we need a new plan of attack a new way to wage war where we don't have to go head first into america's greatest strength and our greatest weakness following our great sun zeus art of war if you're gonna attack your enemy attack him where he can't defend luckily for you times have changed the modern day battlefield is no longer fought with bullets but with ones and zeroes dollars and cents sure there will always be a time for conventional warfare but today instead of storming the desert it's storming the enemy's walls by attracting foreign investors money and not letting that money ever leave your country instead of killing soldiers it's by baiting companies that outsource their workers for dirt cheap labor thereby taking away jobs from the enemy country killing their morale and making them more dependent on you instead of fighting on the european front or the pacific front it's fighting on the economic front the social front instead of deploying troops it's deploying cyber warfare troops that sit behind a computer screen instead of invading and occupying smaller nations it's offering them irresistible loans to build infrastructure projects and taking them over once they can't pay it back war is no longer using force to compel your enemy to your will but rather by using all means armed and unarmed force lethal and non-lethal force by doing whatever it takes and you want to know what the best part is is that while all these revolutionary changes are happening to the battlefield your arch nemesis the u.s are still spending away all their resources building up their conventional forces thinking that they have the most powerful military leaving them with no resources are desired to invest into the real domains the cyber and economic ones but can you really blame them the traditional military industrial complex and defense contracts make a lot of money so lucky for us why would they want to change that's not our job the us military leaders say so like everything else their government does they keep kicking the can down the road like sun tzu said if your opponent doesn't even know they're at war well they've already lost this is that strategy we're at war only it's not being fought by guns and missiles not yet at least it's a war of perception the greatest long-term threat to our nation's information and intellectual property and to our economic vitality is the counterintelligence and economic espionage threat from china that i think it's the most consequential existential threat not just to america just to democracy the world's ever seen but if you think these issues are just an intelligence issue or a government problem or a nuisance largely just for big corporations who can largely take care of themselves you could not be more wrong it's the people of the united states who are the victims of what amounts to chinese theft on a scale so massive that it represents one of the largest transfers of wealth in human history [Music] war combat it's all about deception you make the enemy think you're gonna come out from one corner to shoot but then boom you come out of the other corner and blow them to bits the modern battlefield is no different you make the west believe that you support free trade and globalization while systematically taking advantage of it you tell other countries like the us to say no to protectionism to tariffs well that's literally your entire strategy you waive the carrot of short-term profits in front of your enemies that are drooling at the mouth while using their money to fund your rise to number one china has a fundamentally different system than ours and it's doing all it can to exploit the openness of ours while taking advantage of its own closed system and at the core china's main strategy and advantage over the us is just that the ability to think in decades and centuries instead of quarterly earnings reports or the next election cycle china has a vision a big why a purpose to guide them through all the short-term pain in their journey to world domination with absolute power over their subjects to back it up the u.s on the other hand have grown weak and comfortable from nearly a hundred years of opulence and much like how a spoiled child can never work hard america's prosperity and freedom will be its own downfall they're not willing to give up their comforts to fight a bigger enemy and their government has hardly any control over their own citizens think of china kinda like the old robber barons like rockefeller or jp morgan but at a global level we can use every single dirty trick in the book to crush our competitors the chinese government is engaged in a broad diverse campaign of theft and malign influence and it can execute that campaign with authoritarian efficiency they're calculating they're persistent they're patient and they're not subject to the righteous constraints of an open democratic society or the rule of law every war has different fronts that must be fought in world war ii it was the european front and the asia pacific front for this new cold war there are many different fronts where one of the most important being the economic front china saw how money turned the u.s into a global superpower and how micromanaging everything destroyed the soviet union so china took the best of both worlds they combined the absolute authoritarianism they needed to stay in power but sprinkled on some capitalism to make the money they would need to dominate the world or in other words we realize that money talks on the global stage so we align private profit with national interests china has complete control over the economy so we can do whatever it takes to make sure the right companies succeed in the direction we want and yet we've created one of the freest environments to do business there's no pesky things like the epa better business bureau intellectual property rights and yet the government has the final say on all matters if they think your company is better suited merged with this other company they'll take your company and assets by force and merge it with the other an awful lot of large chinese businesses are state-owned enterprises literally owned by the government and thus the party and even if they aren't china's laws allow its government to compel any chinese company to provide any information it requests including american citizens data on top of that chinese companies of any real size are legally required to have communist party cells inside them to keep them in line the equivalent to the us government forcing apple to have a u.s representative on their board of directors to make sure everything is going according to plan competition among chinese is extremely dog-eat-dog and yet important companies get cash injections and are backed by the government because of this close economy we're able to pull off some very clever tricks that get us ever so closer to world domination one of our greatest tactics is the fact that when foreign investors put money into our country no matter how much money they earn on paper they can never pull it out of the here's how it works number one we attract foreign businesses investors banks hedge funds many of them from the us to invest billions upon billions of dollars over the years into chinese real estate businesses stocks which is not very hard given that we have the biggest population and the biggest new market to make money in number two the investors money is used to make our economy the fastest growing in history while preventing that same money from being used to grow america's economy number three the investors see their money grow on paper which makes them really happy and attracts more investors and number four when investors want to take their earnings out and convert it into let's say usd they can't why because this is our closed economy you have to follow our rules if you want to play and our rule is is that we need this money to stay within our borders to keep funding our astronomical growth as long as more money keeps coming into china unless it's going out all is going according to plan sure with the right person applying the right pressure money can go out of china but for the average foreign firm like chevron sony x on these suckers have had their money trapped here since 2015. now if you're sitting there with your hands stroking your chin wondering this this kind of sounds like a ponzi scheme where investors put money in and their money is used as returns for the investor that came in before them no well i'll let you guys be the judge of that and if you think that trick was clever you have seen nothing yet see every country's currency's value is determined by traders on foreign exchange markets but who says that's how it has to work if we put our un on the market we'd completely lose control over it so the un isn't traded on foreign exchange markets everything happens within our borders its value is whatever we say it is china has printed 30 trillion dollars worth of rmb in a decade like the scale to which they've printed is again it's unprecedented can the chinese run their stock market up absolutely domestically they control the price they control the printing press they control the police they control the narrative and there are many other tricks up our sleeves forcing foreign companies to give up the trade secrets to do business in china when no other nations do that to chinese firms stealing anywhere from two to three trillion dollars worth of intellectual property from the us over the past 10 years and selling it back to them at a discount they all estimate that that number's 200 to 300 billion dollars worth of ip per year there's a return on that annually as well so over the last decade they've stolen you know two to three trillion uh in ip from us we've now reached the point where the fbi is opening a new china-related counterintelligence case about every 10 hours of the nearly 5 000 active fbi counterintelligence cases currently underway across the country almost half are all related to china not allowing western social platforms like google facebook youtube and our economy so we can control the narrative while the west allows all of our government-controlled social platforms into their nation so we can influence their narrative getting us companies to outsource 3.7 million manufacturing jobs to our very poor cheap laborers since 2001 pummeling their middle class even more forcing u.s companies not to spread ideas we don't like like disney hollywood the nba marriott and more all this economic warfare is for one purpose to fund our meteoric rise as the fastest growing economy in history with everyone else's money while fooling everyone into thinking that we're playing by the worlds and that yes you should definitely keep treating us fairly even though we're not treating you fairly and all this economic power allows us to move on to the other fronts of this new cold war like the all too insidious infrastructure fronts infrastructure is one of the most important aspects of a society it is literally the underlying foundation of a country infrastructure also happens to be one of those things that is taken for granted by the populace people in the u.s typically don't go about their dates wondering hey how secure are gas pipelines or electricity grids or who controls the shipping ports and container ships where 90 of our goods travel on [Music] yet if just one of these systems went out it would lead to some catastrophic events that's why in china we understand just how important infrastructure warfare is in our ever more connected world that's why we have a laser focused on infrastructure both domestically and internationally within china we're focused on making our economy completely independent from the outside world where we're not dependent on exports or imports an economy that isn't fragile to the goodwill of others like how every nation including china is right now this is where ghost cities come into play to create this insulated economy china started building entire cities 120 in total each designed to hold between 5 to 10 million people that's why in just two years from 2012 to 2014 china poured more concrete than the us did in the last 100 years because these cities were built ahead of demand there are 50 ghost cities in china 50 cities ranging from twice the size of philadelphia to the size of new york without a soul to be seen and guess what china's plan for an independent super economy was funded by you guessed it the west headed by wall street who probably aren't going to get their money back and every cent of this construction went straight into china's record-breaking gdp numbers so that begs the question if there are 64 million vacant apartments on the market and even more vacant business space in the billions of square feet it would only make sense that real estate prices should have already crashed in china right well no as we learn in the economic front china controls the entire economy including real estate and prices so we simply prevent this new real estate from being sold see what westerners don't understand is that economic growth is very easy if you control everything while we're making our infrastructure more robust at home naturally we're focused on making everyone else's infrastructure more fragile abroad this is where the belt and road initiative or bri comes in a plan to connect nearly 70 nations many of them poor desperate emerging nations around the world by road rail air and most importantly by sea and here's how it works number one find nations with resources we need whether that be cheap labor mined or important locations number two approach these desperate nations with a smile and say that in the name of facilitating free trade and harmony peace and prosperity we'll give you a loan that we know you can't pay back to build infrastructure projects like a seaport to build up your economy and will just collect interest in return a no-brainer deal you'd be crazy to pass it up and then boom step number three once you drown the country in debt it's basically yours and from here you can do whatever you want in the case of the very strategic port of sri lanka when they couldn't make the payments they just gave it back to china with even more land on top of that in the case of africa you can keep milking the resources and cementing your influence and control as these nations start to prosper you can sell to them collect their data and further your influence and all these locations that are practically ours are more avenues for us to send conventional military troops through if that time ever comes more on that later if you want to learn more about this modern day colonialism check out our video called the profitable business of enslaving third world countries along with domestic infrastructure and the bri the last and most important piece of the infrastructure front is 5g [Music] now if you're looking for 5g conspiracy theories go watch some other video because we don't even have to go into that kind of speculation 5g is not just another phone network sure it gives consumers up to 100 times faster speed but for the most part consumers won't be able to take advantage of all that extra juice the real game changer is that this extra speed and bandwidth will make way for a new generation of society built around devices connected to each other whereas 4g only allows around 6 500 devices per square mile 5g can support up to a million devices per square mile this extra capacity means that every aspect of a society's infrastructure planes trains machinery self-driving cars smart homes connected healthcare agriculture cameras the military will be able to communicate with each other over a 5g network more data being collected means that more data can be funneled into ai and machine learning algorithms at an even faster rate and if you thought technology was already moving fast if the highway data travels on gets supercharged the pace of technology will increase at an even more incomprehensible rates we already talked about how fragile nations are to the infrastructure so if the future of infrastructure is powered over 5g networks if one were to control said 5g networks one could theoretically have the keys not to just the kingdom but to the entire modern world including all of one's enemies in our modern world there is perhaps no more ominous prospect than a hostile foreign government's ability to compromise our country's infrastructures and devices if one controlled all 5g networks one could theoretically view all the world's data traveling on those super highways including business plans military plans academic papers engineering plans surveillance camera feeds anything and everything sent over 5g one could also turn off aspects of a nation's infrastructure at will one could collect and feed everyone's data into one's own ai algorithms like one is already doing with the government controlled social media platforms or in other words if china is gonna get back to its glory days on the world stage it would be very advantageous of us to take the same approach we're doing with the belt and road initiative generously offered to build a 5g networks for other nations out of our own goodwill of course but you gotta keep this part extra secret because other countries are starting to catch on to our intentions like japan australia and the uk india those middling americans of course and maybe even the eu if we don't act fast if chinese companies like huawei are given unfettered access to our telecommunications infrastructure they could collect any of your information that traverses their devices or networks worse still they'd have no choice but to hand it over to the chinese government if asked the privacy and due process protections that are sacrosanct in the united states are simply non-existent in china there are many other fronts in this new cold war that we don't have time to get into the cyber warfare front the technology front the social front but there's one more friend worth mentioning an under the radar return to the conventional military fronts as we mentioned in the beginning of this video as long as we're not guaranteed to win the conventional war with the us we'll keep fighting on the more subtle modern day battlefield but china isn't dumb we know that conventional warfare will never go away and that someday we might just have to participate in it and as the west has been funding our rise we've been investing a lot of that money not just a normal infrastructure like we already talked about but also into our military so if or when that time ever comes we can strike china already has more warships than the u.s navy while the u.s has been lowering its icbm count due to international agreements we've been stockpiling hours and regularly show them off and a healthy amount of us military components and raw materials come straight from china the propellant that fires their missiles materials for their night vision goggles their entire telecom system their computers they're entirely dependent on us so for now we'll just keep selling war materials to the americans build up our own power and control and then strike if the time comes so you know that war is all about deception not just conventional fighting you know about our economic front the business front all the different infrastructure fronts at home and abroad and how we're gearing up our conventional fronts so the question remains who's gonna win this new cold war well if the west keeps fighting each other about systematic racism while the concept of racial discrimination doesn't even exist in china with this very own concentration camps and cattle cars mind you if the west keeps calling a certain president a tyrant when there's an actual authoritarian regime a few thousand miles off the coast of california that makes the certain president look like gandhi if consumers keep buying chinese plastic just to save a buck well they better start learning mandarin and let's just calm down and put this [Music] okay confronting this threat effectively does not mean we shouldn't do business with the chinese does not mean we shouldn't host chinese visitors it does not mean we shouldn't welcome chinese students or co-exist with china on the world stage but it does mean that when china violates our criminal laws and international norms we are not going to tolerate it much less enable it the fbi and our partners throughout the u.s government will hold china accountable and protect our nation's innovation ideas and way of life with the help and vigilance of the american people thank you for having me here today speaking of learning mandarin check out today's video sponsor um i mean we don't have a sponsor because not many brands are willing to support this video economic warfare at its finest so i tell you what if you want to support this channel financially and you want more videos like this one check out a course i made on how to land a remote job this is how i got my start and this whole make money online thing with a 40 per hour remote web dev job and i believe it's the most practical way for others to get started as well you don't have to start a business from scratch you learn valuable skills on your own time while making consistent money so you're not starving to death and as we've seen in recent times remote jobs are a lot less fragile than traditional ones and my favorite part is that you can use remote jobs as a jumping off point for whatever you want you can use the extra time to work on a side business like i did or you can be a digital nomad traveling the world which a lot of people do with their remote jobs as well and with this course it walks you through what jobs to go after based on your personality what the best route to learn it are standing out when applying to jobs and interviews and basically everything you need from start to finish and you can start your remote journey right now for a very reasonable price and support this channel at the same time with

4v56-Ho5xxI,hi it's Lily Hubbard here and in today's video I will be talking about the mass mind control experiment that's being taken that's taking place globally and how the world is run by Satanists so I'm shining some light on a really dark trip on some really dark truths and Ephesians 5:11 says have no fellowship with the fruitless deeds of darkness but rather expose them so what is mind control every culture and society is under some form of mind control and I live in Thailand I've been here for the last seven years my husband is Thai and this is a Buddhist country and the the main belief in Buddhism is mindfulness and in mindfulness you're not allowed to think about the past or about the future you're supposed to be always living in the now and this has had a very detrimental effect to the culture to the nuclear family into society because and it's stopped critical thinking if you're not allowed to think about the past you're not allowed to contemplate history to contemplate your path your past actions and if you're not allowed to think about the future you're not allowed to plan for the future or even hope for a better future it keeps people emotionally stunted so I'm from the United States and in the US and Western society in general we are also sold alive through our education system and our governments and our mainstream media and what is not spoken of publicly is the fact that most of the people who run the world are psychopaths they're Satanists they're practicing Satanists and they're pedophiles they are involved in some of the most egregious crimes against humanity that include organ harvesting human and child sex trafficking torture and even cannibalism many of your favorite Hollywood celebrities humanitarians and philanthropists are involved in these activities I know it's shocking and hard to believe believe if you've never heard of this before I've been searching for the truth for nearly a decade and it took me years of researching asking questions and seeking the truth to finally figure out what's going on in the world and I can never truly comprehend how it all worked until God found me and I accepted Jesus as my Lord and Savior and I became a born-again Christ follower it was then that I realized that one could be a Satanist and not even know it in fact most people practice a form of Satanism as the core value of Satanism is the worship of oneself or the God within it is the original lie that the serpent told and they told Eve in the Garden of Eden that if we eat of the fruit of knowledge that we will become like God for years I was on the path of enlightenment I traveled the world seeking answers and searching for mental healing and emotional stability through Eastern religions I was a practicing Hindu and I was involved in various occult activities looking back I can see how Satan used me to influence others and lead people to eternal damnation I was actually a lower-level Illuminati member and I didn't even know it because I was a I was teaching yoga and pushing the belief of reincarnation on people believing that it was not true myself and reincarnation is also the original lie that Satan and the serpent told Eve that if you eat of the fruit you'll never die and that's what reincarnation believes that will never die that we're always being reborn into a new body so when I found out that it was all a lie and that hell was real and that we live in a prison planet and that the god of this world is Satan which is why Jesus had to come here and the only way out of this prison planet is through accepting and Jesus who is the ultimate sacrifice the perfect sacrifice for our sins so we can escape and have eternal life so when I found this was true and this was the truth that I was like so in shock and devastated and this is the ultimate red pill and it's the truth is not an easy pill to swallow which is why the Bible states that narrow is the path that leads to life and few will find it most people don't want to believe in sin or hell even people who claim to be Christians they don't want to accept this as true the type of Christianity that is politically correct and popular is all inclusive it accepts all of the religions as being acceptable paths to salvation and it puts no limits on sin and the desires of this world and this is a lie from Satan Jesus is not an enlightened master and he is not just the son of God Jesus is God Jesus told His disciples I'm the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me so in Ephesians 6:12 it states we do not wrestle against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this age against spiritual hosts of wickedness in heavenly places and what this is saying is that the real enemy is not people it's Satan and his demon army army and Satan is using the most powerful people the richest most powerful people to bring about his Antichrist system to bring forth the Antichrist and the Beast system which will be a global one-world government and one of the tactics used to achieve this goal is through mass reduction of the world's populations it's a form of eugenics and the humanitarians and philanthropists of the world like Bill Gates they are all you Genesis and they are working together to lower the population because they believe that's the way that they are going to save the earth and some of the ways that they are doing this is through genetically modified food spraying the skies with chemtrails abortion and reproductive services vaccinations which cause brain injuries and sterilization subpar medical services Wars and biological weapons like manufactured viruses that will become global pandemics these people are responsible for the release of this current virus and I'm not going to say the name of the virus on this video because I don't want it to be flagged and this is a classic Hegelian dialectic tactic which is problem reaction solution so they have created the problem they know the reaction that they want from us which is panic and fear and they will push their solution which is the New World Order and it's a globalist agenda so right now the world is currently under a mass trauma-based mind control experiment the intense fear that is being pushed on us by our governments and media is causing people to panic and not think rationally or critically their solution to the chaos that they are creating themselves will be increased laws that restrict our freedoms such as forced vaccinations increased surveillance implanted identification chips and a digital currency so these people are just puppets to Satan they're being used by Satan and they don't even know it just like I was used by Satan before and didn't know it and sain wants us to feel powerless and victimized but the Bible says that those who follow Christ are filled with the Holy Spirit and that we have power and authority over the kingdom of darkness and saying himself Jesus States behold I've given you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing will injure you the best thing that you can do right now is to not buy into the fear that they are pushing on us and we can do this by arming ourselves with truth Hosea 4:6 says my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge proverbs 11 9 but through knowledge shall the just be delivered Jesus is the ultimate truth and the Holy Spirit is our comforter if you have not already given your life to Jesus Christ now is the time to do so you must repent ask God to forgive you for your sins and we are all sinners because God is the only righteous and perfect being we must put all of your trust in the Lord it is only through Jesus that we have access to everlasting life and when we know where we are going once we die then death has lost its sting God is ready to do something mighty on this earth we just need to be praying for justice peace and faith I believe in an awakening is taking place right now and we will see science and miracles that go beyond anything that we have ever dreamed for the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob is the god of the impossible I'll be posting more videos going into deeper analysis of the topics covered in this video I'm looking forward to sharing more with you all please subscribe to my youtube channel Lily Hubbard and if you enjoyed this video give a thumbs up which just helps the algorithm thank you all so much god bless you ,3
vk8V4kOugyc,as the Russia plot thickens the deep state is going mainstream right tonight we start with proof the deep state is real in America and that you the American people see what is really going on it's about a deep state trying to drag a crook across the presidential finish line and trying to destroy the man Americans wanted in the Oval Office wants the preserve of conspiracy theorists now the President of the United States calls himself a victim of it unelected deep-set operatives who defy the voters to push their own secret agendas are truly a threat to democracy itself for believers the deep state is a mysterious faction of opposition bureaucrats in Trump's case a shadowy cabal of Obama supporters entrenched in government intent on bringing him down a belief firmly held by Corey Lewandowski Trump's former campaign manager he had a phone conversation with Teresa May that phone conversation transpired in Air Force One I believe Air Force One has a secure line of communication particularly when he's having a conversation with a world leader do you think leaks are evidence of the deep state but no less than of course no less than 30 minutes after hanging up that phone call the media was reporting on the conversation that transpired that should be an issue security CERN that the President of the United States is creating conflict with an old ally isn't that the reason these things are coming out because it's behavior it's troubling a lot of people those are classified conversations and the leaking of classified information is punishable by putting people in prison you're Mike good morning I'm going to let people know I'm a true conservative right wing media sees Robert Mueller's investigation into possible collusion with Russia as the deep state in action before its conclusion Trump's supporters have already made up their minds stance freedom across the world if the deep state has a hand in the Russia investigation then you should be deeply suspicious of its conclusions if any investigation is biased by the Preferences of the people who arranged it you should be deeply skeptical of its conclusions accused architects of the deep state say Trump is using the idea to deflect all criticism former CIA Chief Michael Hayden insists that countering Trump on issues like his travel ban does not equal deep state it shouldn't have come as a surprise but it was a bad idea it made us less safe if you want to call pushing back against that evidence of the deep state go ahead but I come back to my view career professionals governed by the rule of law trying to do the right thing for the country what concerns you what keeps you up at night my grade is concerned that the most destabilizing force in the world today is the United States of America and we appear to be erratic and we appear to be moving back away from the key tenets of our foreign and security policy are you worried of course I'm worried Trump has worked hard to delegitimize the Russia investigation that could come to define his presidency if unfavorable he'll likely do the same with Robert mullahs findings but blaming the deep state will only get him so far Amanda Walker Sky News Washington ,1
EHrrjQ-zVO0,"The Illuminati’s that shadowy cabal that
controls the entire world and ensures free will is an illusion.
They’ve got a big Facebook page, Celebrities like Jay-Z are accused of being members, and there are weird YouTubers like this guy. ""They had weirdos standing up everywhere, and then Beyonce--show a document of this if you can. She does the Illuminati symbol."" But what about the real history of the Illuminati
and how it became what it is today? This is Bavaria, and in 1776
Adam Weishaupt, a law professor, founded the Illuminati. It’s real.
He wanted to spread enlightenment ideals around the world.
The goal was to infiltrate the monarchy and make them more enlightened by entering their ranks. Even though they were so high-minded, they had weird rituals. See these owls? The Illuminati really loved them. And they had invented hierarchies like Novice,
Minerval, and Illuminated. Even though they were weird, they did have
some success around the world. Anywhere from 650 to 2800 members infiltrated
Freemason chapters, may have had influential members like the
writer Goethe, and even might have influenced the Jacobins,
the political club that spurred the French revolution to its most radical heights. But they were destroyed in 1785.
This is Karl Theodor — the Duke of Bavaria — and that year he banned secret societies.
That included the Illuminati. Most historians think that it worked
and the Illuminati disappeared. But if that’s true, then why do we still
think that Drake’s Illuminati today just because he wears owl sweaters? Since the beginning, conspiracy theories have
been part of the Illuminati. This guy, Xavier von Zwack, actually did have
plans to take over the world that were found after the Illuminati was banned.
American historians and preachers thought the Illuminati planted some seeds for the
French Revolution and George Washington even wrote a letter
that claimed the Illuminati had once been a threat.
But the Illuminati lost the limelight thanks to the Freemasons.
This is George Washington as a Freemason, and a lot of founding fathers really were
Freemasons. That inspired the anti-Masonic party.
It was a legitimate movement with big names like John Quincy Adams,
and the Illuminati paranoia faded around the world. So how did the myth stay alive? There were always random books, like this
one from 1918, or book reviews that mentioned the Illuminati.
But most people think the Illuminatus book trilogy of the 1970s
deserves credit for bringing the Illuminati back. It might also be why weird secret symbols
like these pyramids and triangles are associated with the Illuminati.
It was a funny series and gave new life to the conspiracy for an ironic, connected age.
They were an evil organization bent on ruling the world, sure, but they were also kind of
funny. The Illuminati was vague enough to be refit
to any purpose, from the new world order
to religious paranoia, to pop culture curio like Angels & Demons.
It became a joke. But you might believe that's what the Illuminati
wants you to think if you noticed the 14 evil yellow triangles
of power hidden inside this video. The Illuminati only really endures because
it’s disappeared and can look like anything. There’s nothing to worry about.
Nothing at all. Illuminati, Illuminati, Illuminati. So this is my humble little crazy wall and
one of the disadvantages of a crazy wall is that things aren’t as legible as you’d
like them to be. That includes this letter by George Washington. However, the Library
of Congress does tell us what it says, and it says, “It was not my intention to doubt
that the doctrines of the Illuminati and principles of Jacobinism had not spread in the United
States.” So he thought the Illuminati didn’t make it in the United States, so you can rest
assured, but, they were a threat. ",2
xF_VYNtDgN8,"listen it's shocking it's written about in the book of Revelation could it ever happen the answer is unfortunately yes total population control bill Benny says that's what the National Security Agency wants he should know he was technical director of that agency and worked there for more than 30 years he became one of their top analysts perhaps the best code breaker in America before he resigns because of their domestic spying programs he's with us now from Washington bill thank you so much for being with us we're glad to see you well thanks for having me Pat look how big is this apparatus of the NSA we hear about it but you know firsthand well they're I think they're about 40,000 people working at Fort Meade at NSA headquarters close to 40,000 and then they have facilities all around the world plus a number of contractors also associated when probably on the order of a hundred thousand I would think to two hundred thousand that worked for them directly so it's a rather large operation I mean it's it's between ten and fifteen billion dollars a year that they spend on it ever since 9/11 so that's you know quite a quite a bit of money they're investing in it how much data can they acquire is there any limit to it actually it the only limit is in terms of money power availability and space to add to stack equipment to go and collect the data material well they use it well you've said that the ultimate goal is total population control in a democracy that is really scary business it's actually a totalitarian process that's been used down through history I mean that's what totalitarian dictators States they that's what they want to do they want to know everything about the population so they can control it that was the idea between behind the Soviet Union the East German Stasi that was their idea and the Gestapo and the SS and down through history many others is our stuff more powerful than those agencies you mentioned yeah unfortunately it is that's that's the real the real problem I see is that it's the capacity is when you're looking at electronic activity of individuals like when you use a credit card and when you when you make a phone call or email anybody on the on the internet or or do chatter on the internet that can be monitored in near real-time if that if they're necessary otherwise they can capture it collect it store it and then Brett to actively analyze it so it's something that it provides the opportunity to monitor everybody in the country in fact most everybody in the world in near real-time throughout the day and that's that's really a 1984 on steroids really all right now let's take mrs. Joe average living in Topeka Kansas and she goes to the store and buy something with a credit card NSA's got that right then they they have electronic data they'll collect Financial Act transactions sure she calls her friend Myrtle down the street that phone is monitored that call not all of them but a good many of them are recorded certainly all of the fact that they she made that call is is recorded and stored and and what we call graphed that is building relationships that's one of the real problems here it this is a violation of your First Amendment rights under the Constitution you have the right to assemble free free free assembly which means that it doesn't say you have the right to free assembly as long as the government knows about it which is what's happening when the telecommunications companies turn over all their records of phone calls to and from with duration that tells them everybody you're contacting your whole social network on the phone because it's a simple matter of doing a reverse lookup to see who that is that you're calling oh you quit the agency oh she said what they were doing is unconstitutional could you that is clearly unconstitutional but why does the government on doing it that's the reason I been able to at least from what I can see in public in the public domain is they're doing it for law enforcement worldwide and actually the main users of this data are in fact FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration and other law enforcement agencies in the in the country and they they use this data to find criminal activity and then they go arrest people based on this information and then they have to do a parallel construction which means they use normal policing techniques that they would be expected to use to find evidence that would justify and show probable cause for an arrest then they substitute that for the NSA data in the in the courts in fact that's one of the one of the one of the things that happened in challenging that process was one of the lawsuits was Amnesty International vs. clapper and that made it to the Supreme Court and the only way they got rid of that was to basically lie to the Supreme Court and say that well if anybody had any of this data used against them in the court of law or anything that the defendant they defendants would be told and that was simply a lie nobody has been told to date all right when I when I think of this it's just horrible what do they give this information to the IRS that's the other problem the Drug Enforcement Administration has a special unit the Special Operations Division the sod and that's the that division is supposed to its primary purpose is to look into the NSA data to find criminality and criminal activity the members of that are the CIA the NSA the FBI course DEA DHS and the IRS now that means that the IRS as active action actually has actually Act access to all the data of the social networks of everybody in the country because NSA builds those in the databases that they have from the billing data or they or the contact data that's provided by the telecommunications companies so this in effect allows them if they're they're interested in stopping anybody getting a 501 C 3 application in for tax-exempt status for for say someone in the Tea Party or the Act Occupy group or any religious group attempting to get 501 C 3 or tax-exempt status they would look could look into that mapped graphed relationships and see if you're a part of any organization that they perhaps when a stone wall or slow roll and prevent from becoming politically active and that's what's been going on they've had access to this data and one person was testifying in the the House and Judiciary Committee I believe it was about some of the questions they were being asked by the IRS and one of the questions that was asked that gave me the idea that they were using this information was this one person was asked what what is their relationship with another person there was a specific name well the question I had was not what was their relationship but how did the IRS know about that relationship the only way I could think of that they would know was B through this access to the data at NSA which is where all that information is mapped out so what you're saying is the NSA slips this stuff to them they read it and get a clue getting it and then they go through their normal procedures and act like it they didn't get the information but he got it from another source so they they pull the wool over Congress do you know the congressman yes go ahead and they also use that in court which means in my in my sense that that that means their perjuring themselves in court so I call that a planned program perjury policy run by the Department of Justice of the United States you know I'm horrified in all this and I'm sure the average of America you know most of the congressmen are they come out of neighborhoods and they're elected by the people do you think Congress has even a clue as to what you're talking about probably not not a complete clue but I think that that's part of the reason that representatives a marsh and Conyers got a coalition of members of the house to try to unfund NSA's activity last year they almost made it by about 12 votes they lost 12 by 12 votes but they came pretty close for a first try so there is a move in Congress to to limit and stop this and it really is all of this activities it's unconstitutional into the first Fourth and Fifth Amendment's the first because they're giving you or your associations and everything the government is collecting that data the fourth because they're looking at the content it's not just metadata that they're collecting its content also and and and the fifth because they're using data that you knew that content of data that you pass between your friends and neighbors and and use that against you in a court of law that's a violation of the fifth amendment that is to have you're not you are claim you can claim the Fifth Amendment not to testify against yourself well that's a violation of that too how come some little guy didn't come after you in the middle of the night or have they they have actually they sent the FBI at me in 2007 and tried to intimidate me to stay quiet what about Snowden is he a traitor or hero I looked at him as a as doing a absolute public service not just to the people of this country but to the world because he produced evidence that's irrefutable by our government that's the crimes against the Constitution and the laws that we had over time anyway so that was irrefutable evidence of what they were doing and so they cannot deny it now what kind of megalomaniac would want to do something like this is monstrous and these guys I mean where does the mindset come from that divides us all this stuff well that's what I objected to and why I left NSA early on back in 2001 because I saw this coming I mean I had worked the Soviet Union problem for almost 30 years and and it was very clear to me that in October of 2001 the NSA and government the US government started adopting the procedures and techniques and processes that the Soviet Union and the Stasi and all of the countries behind the Iron Curtain were using so we were we were actually adopting their procedures it was very clear to me that that was what was going on all right last question the average person doesn't have a vestige of knowledge of what you're talking about they just trust their government what are we going to do as citizens well you see let me let me say something about that first that's that's really the problem here in this country you see from my where I see what I see is we have not had a dictator in this country for almost since George the third for almost two hundred and forty years so we've been very comfortable over those two hundred forty years at least kind of depending on our government to do the right thing and that's what we've all been accustomed to them doing that is we trust them and have trusted them for a long time and so we don't have that knowledge of what dictators and dictatorial processes are but if you look at it the Germans today are the ones who are really upset about this and the reason they're upset is because they've got living memory of the Stasi and living memory of the SS and Gestapo so they're very familiar with these techniques and procedures and that's why they're very upset to me I think the only way we can get out of this is to fire everybody in DC that's the only way to do it you have to go out and vote you have to get active you can't stay quiet and let this happen you have to stand up and oppose it Bill Bailey thank you so much you're great to Patriot and keep speaking out and oh well as prayers for your protection because I can't imagine think unless you keep on talking but maybe they don't man well folks if you want to learn more about Bill Binney and the NSA you can go to our website there's more detail about it and you know something is he was talking the Bible makes a statement in the book of Revelation that people could not buy or sell without the mark of the beast and you said okay there is no way that there's any governmental agency that could enforce something like that and what this man who is the technical director the NSA former technical director is saying is that the government now has the technique to do this worldwide you know Google has maps of every if you have a little shack up in the hills someplace Google's got a map of how to get there and that's a private agency and you know your credit cards your telephone calls but the thing is what he's saying is that you pick up the phone and call your girlfriend and that's monitored and that's recorded and it's it's frightening you don't have to be saying you know I'm wondering a lot against the government but it just it's a normal conversation and they call it metadata and all that stuff and we don't understand it enough so we say well oh yeah well we don't have terrorists we don't have blowing up our airplanes well of course we don't but is it the price of safety for a few passengers on an occasional airplane is that worth taking away the liberties of all the people and the answer is no but this is Big Brother it is what is written in the book of Revelation and it finally can happen in our lifetime this is scary stuff shocking really shocking I remember reading 1984 and books like the late great planet Earth and thinking that could never happen in our country people would never buy into that and here we sit well it's like the old business of the Frog and the water you can heat it up slowly and we're more and more accustomed to it and every time it comes out and they say oh it's okay it's the USA PATRIOT Act it was put in by George Bush these are good guys and this is you got a nice general up there three-star general he's got a benign looking face and you figure he's not gonna hurt you and so he's in charge and then somebody else well we also grew up being taught and believing that the check and balance system in our government was going to take care of all this this is huge the the gathering is in the billions and billions and billions of bits and it is we finally have the capacity to control every human being on the face of the earth clean him up that's what he said throw the bums out let's start afresh ",3
lYKtt7nBOIg,turkey and not china will cause the third world war and aradhwan needs to be ousted in order to avert it ardhwan is going haywire picking fights with anyone and everyone turkey is turning up a perfect storm and as things stand it is quite obvious that turkey and or china will cause the third world war unless aradhwan is ousted in time in contrast to turkey china has been very tactical in choosing the scale and situation of confrontation and backs down when it realizes that the situation may go out of control they have done it in the himalayas with india the south china sea with asean neighbors and the east china sea with japan the turkish high command is raking up so many disputes igniting all the crevices in asia minor and west asia simultaneously it is engaged in libya eastern mediterranean sea the caucasus region where the azerbaijan and armenia conflict has taken more than 200 lives and of course syria turkey is fighting several powers including france greece the uae and russia and is also locked in heated diplomatic fights with israel and saudi arabia the conversion of the higher sophia into a mosque has also rubbed the entire christian world the wrong way in history it is either one unfortunate incident or an unrestrained power that has caused the world wars and the way ankara is acting right now shutting any scope for diplomacy and brewing the worst blend of conflicts it is a highly belligerent turkey under president erdogan that could cause serious trouble to the world ankara's eastern mediterranean struggle showcases its ambitions to reassert its dominance on greece and the balkan region in general contrary to its aims it was able to successfully antagonize france and irk the usa as well it has also been involved with the uae france and russia in the power struggle of different factions in libya where the turkey-backed faction is at the losing end the situation in the caucasus which as per french president emmanuel macron is a creation of turkey because of its total support to azerbaijan has shunned any possibility of an early armistice here too we can see that the situation is escalating and the matter may demand direct involvement of the us or russia to douse the fire if we talk about the situation in syria turkey is consistently mobilizing its troops at the border and its proxies in syria to confront and demolish any kurdish united front and it is getting into a direct confrontation with russia in fact turkey is locked in a proxy battle with russia on three fronts libya syria and nagorno-karabakh turkey is also a safe heaven for hamas the islamist extremist section of the palestinian cause which controls the gaza strip turkey is contributing its utmost to keep the region currently it is hosting meetings of top palestinian leaders thereby paving way for a turkish-controlled palestinian elections aradhwan has been dreaming of becoming the new khalifa and reviving the ottoman empire and it has been at loggerheads with saudi arabia by trying to replace the saudis as leader of the muslim ummah however ardhwan has shown to the ummah that he has been hypocritically wrong on the abraham accords he says the gulf countries uae and bahrain have betrayed the palestinian cause by signing the accords but turkey itself has had diplomatic ties with israel which go way back the way in which arudhwan is acting is a telltale sign of a person with impractical ambitions is most likely to plunge the region into a regional conflict which in no time will spiral into an all-out war just as the ottomans lost in the first world war owing to their fanatical decisions and genocidal tendencies case in point being the armenian genocide turkey seems to be repeating its first world war follies and with aradhwan at home of affairs it is very pertinent that it will lose quite miserably but at what cost ankara is likely to push the world into a major conflict that could result in loss of human lives apart from economic devastation thus the cost to benefit analysis says the situation will be bad on all metrics for turkey all of humanity will lose and to save the world from this probable destiny urdhva needs to return to his senses or just lose power it becomes the duty of the whole world to come together against aradhwan and against his actions of turning turkey into a belligerent theocracy ,2
WyAtI8UUlbM,there's a plan being put together right now by the global elite to bring the world under control and direct almost every area of your life including your business your education your family your money and more now everything you know is about to change and the world we are going into is not the one that we're leaving behind now i'm gonna explain what's happening what to expect and most importantly what we need to be doing to protect ourselves [Music] hey everyone mark here now today i am talking about the well really not so secret but still relatively unknown agenda to take over the world now it sounds pretty hyped up but when i explain what's happening you're going to understand now you might have recently heard people talking about quotes like it's time to reevaluate the global economic order and maybe you've also heard like never let a crisis go to waste well those quotes are coming together and there is a plan and it is happening really really fast now i've been watching this happen for decades but it's coming together at a speed that i never imagined and i'm imagining that it's also catching you off guard as well um so what does it all mean well in order to understand what it all means then and more importantly not just what's happening but where is it going then in order to understand that we really have to go back to the beginning so in order to do that we're going to jump back in time all the way back to 1944. now if you've been watching this channel for a long time you might know what that date means 1944 i've referenced it many times and that is the time of the bretton woods agreement um yes the book the creature from jekyll island um and so that's where basically the world got together and formed this bretton woods agreement and basically that is when the world went on to this gold standard so the united states said we will hold all the world's gold for them and then we will back the u.s dollar to gold and then all the countries of the world will now peg their currencies to the dollar and so everything will be pegged to the dollar everything's backed by and then everything's backed by gold but what's mostly what's more important about this is not the fact of going into the gold standard that's not really what we're talking about today what's more important about this is it really was the first time that the whole world got together and agreed on something all right and that is the big piece that we're going to focus on today it's not about gold today it's not about the dollar it's not about fiat well it is about that too so the world came together all the countries of the world came together and decided to do this and they created something called the imf that's the international monetary fund and so basically all the countries of the world the elite who are running these things and really it was just a handful of bankers in a room um and so they came together and decided they were going to coordinate this and each country based on their economic output their gdp they would have to contribute money to the imf this new imf that was created now fast forwarding through time the world seemed to be kind of coordinated together but of course the u.s could not restrain themselves they had to continue to print more and more money of course why wouldn't they want to it's kind of human nature and so the rest of the world knew that they were doing this the rest of the world knew that the us was printing more dollars than the gold that they had backed up and so the world started saying hey we don't trust you anymore give us our gold and fast forwarding all the way to 1971 president richard nixon said enough we are done with this we are off the gold standard and at that point everything fell apart so from 1971 forward the world uh has been moving away from each other so in 1944 they came together they kind of stayed together but started falling apart in 1971 officially the world broke apart um and since 1971 um the world has you know the independent independent countries have been working of course independently now since that time we have started to see accelerated calls for um countries asking to remove the the dollar as the world reserve standard so we've seen china of course calling for the end of the dollar um i made a video i think it was about a year ago you can see it here the bank of england mark carney got in front of the bis the bank of international settlements it's the central bank of central banks and he got up and stood in front of him and said we have to end the world reserve currency of the dollar so people have been calling it for a long time but um like i said since that agreement ended in 1971 we've seen countries all working independently all right we haven't seen that coordination and even just a year or two ago i was making comments in regards to cryptocurrencies and i said that you know the world can't seem to get a agree or coordinate on anything how would they ever agree and coordinate to crack down on cryptocurrencies that was just a year or two i was thinking that but now look what happened we have a pandemic happen worldwide and boom all of a sudden the whole world is coordinated every single government is working in coordination with with each other almost overnight it's been amazing to see this happen i couldn't have imagined this a year or two ago and now what we're starting to see are calls for the great reset all right now you might have heard of that you maybe haven't this video isn't really going to dive into the great reset um specifically but we are going to talk about that but of course you can go do more research or leave me a comment if you want me to talk about the great reset in more detail but basically we have the world economic forum the u.n united nations the imf international monetary fund these are all organizations that control the world world economic forum um un imf et cetera and there's other globalist elites like the mckinsey consultants et cetera and they're all calling for this um great reset well now just over the last couple of days we've seen the imf again the imf which was created out of bretton woods that is like the world bank basically um and the managing director crystalina georgieva sorry if i pronounced that wrong crystalline georgieva she has now come out and said we need a new bretton woods agreement a bretton woods 2 is what she's calling for now what does that mean is she asking the world to go back onto the gold standard i mean that would be pretty good if it was right but that's not what's happening all right so in order to understand what it means what i want to do is i want to look at what they said so what did they say and then we can try to interpret that so like i said first of all it is not going back to a new gold standard if that was the case uh i would be cheering for that we'd be hearing a lot more about that but we know back last year july of last year 2019 federal reserve chair jerome powell he outright said no we will not be going back to a new gold standard so he said that last year he already told us that's not happening he said that a gold standard would force the federal reserve to stabilize the dollar price of gold oh no that sounds horrible but of course they don't want to do that because they want to be able to create as many dollars as they can so he said that it would force them to stabilize the dollar price to gold yes of course that's what it means but he doesn't want to do that the imf managing director said that the pandemic will shrink the world's economy by 4 percent this year and remove 11 trillion dollars of economic output by next year of course it will right the entire world coordinated together to shut the whole world economy down at the same time simultaneously and because of that no crops are growing no manufacturing's being done no money is being done no travel is being done because of that 11 trillion dollars of economic output was gone it was forced to be gone it was taken out now she continued to go on and said quote once again we face two massive tasks to fight the crisis today and build a better tomorrow so see what i'm talking about never let a crisis go to waste so she says hey we have to fight this crisis today but we're going to use this as a way to build a better tomorrow now that sounds great i mean sure we all want a better tomorrow don't we i mean it sounds nice and warm and fuzzy but what do they really want all right what do they really want well they want more control right they want more control they want the countries to bow down to them it's not enough just to control the one country they want to go back to the days of the bretton woods agreement where a couple guys in a room basically could control the entire world that's broken apart and they need to get that control back together and how are they going to do it let me explain so what they're doing is they force the world's economies to shut down therefore they've lost 11 trillion dollars as per the imf is what they said now what they're doing is they're calling for expansions of loans by the imf to poor countries so the countries that can't afford to lose that money they're going bankrupt they're dying over there so the imf well hey no worries we'll loan you some money oh you're going broke too how about you get some money oh you need money okay how about i loan you money now in the bible it says that the borrower is servant to the lender and that's exactly what they're doing they're lending out money and putting people in under servitude and by loaning them money by bailing them out they can increase their influence and control over them she said quote the fund is providing debt relief to its poorest members and with the world bank we support extension by the g20 of the debt service suspension initiative the debt services suspension initiative think about that so they will take away their economic growth they will then force them to take their debt and then they'll offer them this debt suspension hmm do you think that has a couple strings with it what do you think leave me a comment and let me know but these loans are going to play an essential role in giving the imf a leg up in the coming rush of central bank digital currency cbdc's now i've been talking about this quite a bit we have china rolled out their own cbdc just a couple weeks ago we have you know i believe that the united states is rushing to get theirs out probably sometime next year and lots of other countries are also working on the same i'm not going to go through a full list of that right now but what's happened is these countries are still sovereign and now they're creating their own currencies but the imf doesn't like that the imf doesn't want all these countries out there to have all their own currencies they want all of them to come back under the fold like bretton woods remember they're talking about bretton woods 2. bretton woods one was where the whole world was using the dollar that was backed by gold they don't want all these countries to have all these independent currencies they want them all to come back under and so again this will give the imf a leg up in the coming rush of central bank digital currencies about which the imf along with the g20 the world bank and the bank of international sediment settlements released a report last week to formalize for use in the banking system so the bis the bank of international settlements which is the central bank of all central banks the world bank the imf the g20 the top 20 countries they've all come together and they've put this report they formalized this in a report of putting their cbdc's out there before all these other countries do that so if they can crush the global economies and then extend the much needed credit to them then they can control their money and not let them get out ahead of their own digital currencies right but it doesn't just stop there bretton woods stopped there okay bretton woods was about the money but not this this is bretton woods too it's going to be bigger and better so it doesn't stop with the money it's not just the financial control they want it's not just your government or your own personal finances they want to control it's they want to control everything they want to control your health they want to control your business so consider georgieva's inclusion of coven 19 in the same sentence with climate change so just as the pandemic has shown that we can no longer ignore health precautions she said we can no longer afford to ignore climate change that's their third imperative so they're putting it together now so now kovid our health and climate change is all together and now that's the imf's third imperative so not just the money no no no no now we have to focus on your help now we have to focus on the economy and they put all this uh as really explained in a report titled quote avoiding a climate lockdown it was put together by university college london economics professor and united nations european government advisor mariana i forget her last name but inside they warned us and i'll quote protecting civilization's future will require dramatic interventions avoiding this scenario will require a green economic transformation and thus a radical overhaul of the corporate governance finance policy and energy systems wow let me just let me just let me just cover that again so uh a radical overhaul of corporate governance so the way you run your business finance all your money um policies so the education that you learn how you treat and train your people and energy systems for the entire energy system from oil to electricity renewables et cetera that's a lot they want to take over a lot don't they so now that we understand the history what they did what they're trying to do now where does all this lead all right this is not a bunch of random circumstances this is a playbook that's been playing out and so because we know that it's a playbook we can see where it's leads now you can already see from the quotes and the statements made by the leading globalists concerning the great reset and it shows that we are not looking at just changing from one currency to another all right what we're trying to do or what they're trying to do is transform our entire existence now per the general secretary of the international trade union confederation sharon burrow she said i'm quoting but above all the long-term perspective is about rebalancing economies or put another way we need a form of socialism so they want to get all the economies rebalanced where basically everybody puts their money in the pot and then they divide it all back out which is yes again socialism now if this all sounds scary it is it is very scary it's very scary it's something that you should definitely be paying attention to it's definitely something that you should be concerned about but what are we going to do about this all right what am i going to do about this what should you be doing about this so let me give you a couple points the first thing that you should be doing is one you need to be paying attention now if this is all news to you then you're not paying attention enough of course you're watching this channel so i'm trying to fill you in so we need to be paying attention we need to be knowing what's going on we need to see as these walls are starting to close in on us and we have to also understand where the lifeboats are all right where do we get out how do we protect ourselves and so that's what i am 100 focused on for me myself my family and i'm sharing all that information back with you so we need to pay attention and we need to know where the walls are closing in and where those lifeboats are going to be we need to stay educated so we need to like i said continue to pay attention watch these videos read reports et cetera and then we need to be putting our money into real hard assets so they're basically creating more fake money no they're not going back to the bretton woods agreement of going back to a hard sound money system of gold no no no no they are moving forward into more debt based money central bank digital currencies capturing the economy and so for us we need to get out of that fake counterfeit money system that continues to lose value and put our money into real hard assets of course land real estate commodities gold copper silver things like that i always invest for cash flow everyone should be investing for cash flow and things like that we also want to focus on getting our wealth outside of the financial system so again gold is a way to do that bitcoin is a way to do that and things like that that is the lifeboat that we have right now don't get stuck in their system we need to start moving outside the system which is what i talk about all the time now again this video is not to scare you although it is scary but hopefully you understand the walls are starting to close in and you need to be paying attention leave me a comment down below and let me know what you think do you need me to dig in more to this do you want you want me to explain more of these concepts let me know what you think i'd love to hear from each one of you otherwise give me a thumbs up on this video if you like it and if you don't like the video that's okay give me a thumbs down but again leave me a comment and let me know why and that's all i got for you today all right to your success i'm out now just a last minute reminder i am hosting a special live presentation it's happening tonight you can find the link down in the description we are going to talk about all this that's happening and the wealth transfer that's creating and talking about real solutions that you can do um so again it's a live presentation and i would hope to see you there

vt51cHuAygE,[Music] [Music] [Applause] get ready china has started the final stages of its plan while the u.s economy is crashing hi and welcome to the financial argument channel china is a sleeping lion napoleon once warned let her sleep for when she wakes she will shake the world i don't know if the lion that napoleon was talking about woke up but it is certain that the world economies are shaking except for china's i know it's too early to say that china won but it's not too early to say who's losing now we know that almost every country's economy especially the u.s economy is experiencing a collapse and financial crisis unprecedented in history but china seems to have pulled itself out of it at least for now the latest data shows us that the economies of all g20 countries experienced a massive slump in the second quarter excluding china china grew by 3.2 percent in the second quarter while the uk shrank by 21.7 the us by 9.1 percent and the eurozone by 15 india which has recently experienced border tension with china and i think the tensions will continue rising had the worst second quarter with an economy shrinking by 23.9 percent there's more additional data indicates that china is the only country with a strengthening economy while all the rest of the world's economies undergo a painful collapse since march 2020 china has exported 151.5 billion face masks 1.4 billion protective suits and 209 000 respirators to the rest of the world while all this was happening we were standing in modern breadlines trying to get food from a dwindling supply at the food bank or trying to get toilet paper at walmart and millions of americans were filing for unemployment at the department of labor in addition china's exports in august increased by 9.5 compared to august 2019 exceeding expectations while recovery is still just a fantasy for many countries especially the us china is recovering and getting stronger as reported by the civil aviation administration of china civil aviation flights reached 90 percent of pre-crisis levels with more than 13 000 daily flights on top of that at the recent china international fair for trade and services in beijing the civil aviation administration also announced that it had signed international aviation transportation agreements with 96 countries and regions within the scope of the belt and road initiative there is no doubt that china is building a fast and efficient air bridge for the belt and road initiative to expand its passenger and freight services before going into details of the chinese belt and road project it's worth mentioning that while all this is happening the u.s aviation industry has been in a deep crisis since march 2020 as i detailed in my previous financial argument videos although billions of dollars have been pumped into the industry many giant u.s airlines are seriously in debt and on the verge of bankruptcy unemployment in the u.s airline industry has been rising and now the jobs of more than 75 thousand u.s airline employees even pilots are at risk with all employment sectors of our country collapsing china's growing strength poses a risk to everyone it's important to recognize this and tell the truth but sadly some of us refuse to see it of course there are officials who are aware of china's growing strength and the threat it poses president trump made a statement about these developments at a press conference on monday trump noted that the united states intends to halt its economic relations with china threatening to penalize american companies creating overseas jobs and prohibit companies that do business with china from winning federal tenders president trump said he wants to end u.s reliance on china and see made in the usa rather than made in china on goods produced by american companies therefore he wants american companies to move their chinese factories to the united states but i think that seems unlikely to happen the reason why some of the products we buy today are so cheap is that they are made in china american industry is unlikely to be able to manufacture goods at the same low prices american companies in china have shown that they do not take this situation too seriously according to a survey by the american chamber of commerce in shanghai 92 percent of the respondents said they would stay in china we had a week full of political speeches vowing a tougher stance on china and it's obvious that the tension and pressure will increase as we get closer to the elections but the main question is will markets which are already collapsing be able to handle this heavy pressure it's worth remembering that this struggle for domination between the u.s and china has a technological and military side as well as an economic side a report presented to the u.s congress by the u.s department of defense and published in early september includes china's military development providing important data for us as the competition between the two countries is sharpening i reviewed the report in detail i won't talk much about military issues because i focus on economics here at the financial argument channel however the report emphasized that china's advantages outweigh the u.s in certain military fields the report also indicated that china was likely to focus on using its navy to protect its global interests as well as using naval capacity to prevent u.s operations around the world already this week news released by china proves the accuracy of the report for the first time in its history china conducted a drill with two aircraft carriers this chinese military exercise is read as a show of strength to the usa and demonstrating chinese technological skills and achievements they also sent a message with that practice exercise using real equipment in many border regions unlike the soviet union china has tried to downplay its potential as a military threat focusing especially on the fields of economy and technology but now they have raised the stakes huawei and 5g are other issues that have raised concern recently considering the sensitivity of the u.s we can see how important these issues are china has drawn global attention with its growing economy and industry over the last 30 years and its production capacity has significantly reduced inflation in the world economies however there are big problems awaiting china one of which is the potential for demographic collapse according to estimates by 2030 the elderly population of china will exceed the young population and each senior citizen will be supported by only two working age adults by 2039 while couples have been encouraged to have children for the country registrations for marriage have fallen every year since 2013. the divorce rate has increased annually since 2006 and average fertility rates continue to fall hitting 1.7 in 2020 anything below 2.1 indicates a declining population on top of that there are approximately 34 million more men than women in china and currently 24 million single men of marrying age who are unlikely to ever marry or have children according to the general belief china controls 1.4 billion people by increasing their welfare china's rise has been built on labor-intensive manufacturing and has very little in the way of a social safety net if china doesn't invest in technology and r d this aging population will be in trouble that's why china has pushed for technological development and back in 2008 it was officially accused of technology theft a special 301 report published by the american department of commerce states that china has copied or stolen patented american intellectual property joseph nye richard haas and other experts who report on china have stated that china can no longer continue doing this and needs to develop its own patents that's exactly why xi jinping came to power xi jinping has embarked on continuous efforts and investments to develop chinese industry and increase productivity huawei oppo vivo and tiktok have all developed as a result while nokia and erickson dominated the mobile phone market before she 51.3 percent of the mobile phones used in china in 2015 under xi were of chinese origin this is of course thanks to quality improvement not only that but 371 million mobile phones manufactured domestically were exported and the majority of them were mobile phones produced by chinese r d xi jinping did all this thanks to supply-side structural reforms and this miracle was called the chinese dream apart from mobile phones huawei has embarked on an even more ambitious business 5g the money invested in the 5g project by the people's republic of china has exceeded 180 billion 5g offers significant economic opportunities beyond the internet and communication considering the emphasis placed on industry 4.0 by the west and the point it has already reached the process of smart manufacturing and creating new operating models will speed up thanks to 5g if 5g is based in china countries with american military assets and the security of many military operations information and intelligence data will be under threat it's not difficult to predict how disastrous the result will be if the databases the nsa collected from europe are transferred to a chinese infrastructure that's why the nsa has officially visited a lot of countries in europe as you can see the usa is concerned not only about china's potential commercial gains but also its potential loss of security information apparently china believes that the time has come taking advantage of the collapse of its rival america and the rest of the world's economies and has started to put all its cards on the table china will not hesitate to make its biggest moves in the uncertainty before the november elections what will the next few months bring it's best to prepare for a worst-case scenario thanks for watching and your support of the financial argument

3EKeMyTYowg,"we are currently going through some tough times with a new disease spreading throughout the world and the economy seemingly going through its worst period since the Great Depression but there have been a few strange things that have been going on in the background of all of this chaos that is because as we have seen throughout history strange things tend to happen during desperate times for example after World War 2 tensions were high between the United States and the Soviet Union as both superpowers began jockeying for position to see who would become the world's one true superpower and this potential threat of a war caused some of the greatest technological advancements in history you see both the USSR and the United States had ballistic missiles that would launch stay within the Earth's atmosphere and then eventually hit their target from a few hundred kilometers away but the distance between Moscow and Washington DC was seven thousand eight hundred kilometers so if these superpowers wanted to be able to hit each other with a missile strike they would need a new piece of technology so that is when the USSR developed the first intercontinental ballistic missile or ICBM in 1957 it was the first missile capable of entering sub orbital space and hitting a target on the other side of the planet but almost by accident the USSR had developed something else in an effort to ensure the safety of its country the Soviets developed ICBMs and inadvertently built the technology that connected human civilization to space within months after the first ICBM test in 1957 the USSR used the same ICBM to launch the first satellite into space that they called Sputnik now today we view Sputnik as a technological masterpiece but during its time it was viewed as one of the scariest things in the history of the Western world in fact after the Soviets launched Sputnik it created a worldwide panic called the Sputnik crisis this is when the public experienced a lot of fear and anxiety over the technological gap between the West and the USSR you see the United States viewed Sputnik as a serious threat to national security so President Eisenhower said that the United States will respond with resourcefulness and vigor and because of this the president was able to get enough public support to create two agencies NASA and DARPA he was also able to dramatically increase spending on education and research and development of new technologies and over the course of the next decade the USSR and the United States would keep trying to one-up each other this would eventually be known as the space race and the space race led to innovations that would reshape our entire world for example DARPA created the Internet has a way of sending information from one point to another in a safe and secure manner during the Cold War another innovation was that computers became significantly more advanced during this time because the on-the-fly calculations needed to put a spaceship onto the moon were much greater than what humans could handle into the space race and cold war ended up creating other spin-off technologies like GPS cat-scans athletic shoes water purification artificial limbs and much more so a perceived national security threat in the 1950s from both the USSR and the United States ended up catalyzing the creation of new technologies that would create a better world for the future and that might be one of the things that we are seeing today even though it might be happening in the background for example vaccines normally take about four years to develop from the time that scientists start experimenting with new vaccine ideas to the time where the vaccine is actually approved for the public use but at this time it seems to be a little bit different the entire world views this new virus as a serious threat just like how most people in the world felt during the Cold War so because of this more funding and public support is now going towards biotechnology research in hopes of neutralizing this new threat and here's what we are seeing so far well throughout history vaccines have worked by injecting weakened or killed versions of a virus into the person getting the vaccine but that process takes a long time and then it was just going to take too long this time around so around the world researchers have begun experimenting with new ways to create vaccines that might be 5 10 or even 20 times faster than they have ever before one of these methods that is shown promise is RNA vaccination it works by injecting RNA into the cells in your body which will then produce proteins that are identical to the pathogen that you want to protect yourself from and even though there have been no RNA vaccines approved for medical use yet we might see the approval of a vaccine occur over the next several months rather than the next several years and that got me thinking that this new vaccine technology might be something we look back on in a few decades and view it as an amazing thing that came out of this global threat another piece of technology that has emerged during this pandemic is that of medical AI you see the Canadian company blue dot actually identified there was a cluster of unusual pneumonia cases happening in China nine days before it was identified by the World Health Organization this means that for the first time in human history an AI was able to spot an outbreak of a disease before humans even knew about it and if AI systems like this keep advancing we might be able to spot patient zero of a new disease almost immediately and prevent future outbreaks from ever occurring and AI has also begun to play a role in diagnosing new patients at near lightning speed Alibaba claims that it's AI diagnostic system has been able to accurately detect viruses using chest scans with 90% or more accuracy and this diagnosis only takes the system roughly 15 seconds to complete meanwhile on average it takes about 15 minutes for a human to make the same diagnosis so right now it is possible that we are witnessing AI take its first big leap into biotechnology on a global scale but there is also something else that is a little strange that I see going on has anyone else noticed how much geopolitical tensions have lowered recently I mean if you were told at this time last year that China would be trying to lead global humanitarian efforts and that the United States would be assisting North Korea and Iran in any sort of fashion you would have probably thought the world was ending but this is what happens when even longtime adversaries have a common new threat and stories like this have occurred throughout history warning example is that during the thick of World War one there was a battle taking place between the Germans and the Russians in 1917 Lithuania but over the course of several days large packs of wolves began attacking nearby villages and then eventually they showed up on to the front lines of the battlefield and once they showed up the Wolves began ferociously attacking the injured which caused the Russians and Germans to call for a temporary ceasefire so that they could hunt down the Wolves together during the ceasefire the Russians and Germans were side by side hunting down about 50 wolves in total and chasing even more off of the battlefield the moral of the story is that when there is a common foe people tend to ignore the differences that they have with one another just to try their best to help each other survive and this is a perfect example of why every president throughout history has always had their highest approval ratings during or immediately after a negative global event for example Trump's highest approval rating is well right now Obama's took place during the Great Recession George Bush's was right after 9/11 and Harry Truman and Franklin Roosevelt's were during World War two the point that I'm trying to make here is that during times of crisis people tend to come together I mean right now we are seeing Republicans and Democrats work together to create a two trillion dollar stimulus package that is centered around universal basic income and doesn't raise any taxes both sides would have thought that this was crazy just eight weeks ago but now everyone has put their differences aside in order to try to help out the American people even if it is only a temporary agreement you see sometimes good things can come out of bad times even if it is really tough to see right now we might look back on this period of time in well 30 years or so as a time where the world came together innovated and solved the crisis together and if you enjoyed this video please check out my documentaries playlist on my channel where I have a bunch

Ew9oewvyd0M,"Umm.. (stutters) There's, there's some, there's some pretty good ones. Uhh.. Especially, you know one of the crazy things when you do these live Q&As is some of them are very silly, so we got one - ""Mark, are the allegations true that you're secretly a lizard?"" Umm.. (stutters) I'm gonna, I'm gonna have to go with no, on that. I, I am, I am NOT a lizard. Umm.. But you know keep the high quality comments coming in. Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, WELL!!! Mr. Suckerberg, dunked yourself into a hole! Mr. SSSucker! SSSSUCKERBURG!! Not a lizard people, he said. We've been seeing Mark Zuckerberg act strange for a long time, a long time now from, from the infamous or famous meme. Nice job team. ""New face filters on Instagram today."" ""This is my favorite one so far. Nice job team!"" New face filter on Instagram today. This is my favorite one so far. Nice job team, Something is cLeArLy off with Mark Suckerberg's Antics before where what is it? Why is the man? Leading a social media network so incapable Of social ness This I just want to warn you guys what I'm about to show you next Might shock you. It might... ZZZzzuck
(suck) To watch especially for you Mark, If you're watching. I know you are :). I know you're watching Mark. Well I know you're sweating.. Or can you sweat Mark? Are you capable of human? things? Or do you just shed your skin? [Video] You kind of need to remind yourself that you need to focus, and- umm and try not to let stuff bother you as much as possible But it is gonna bother you because you're Human, and I was human I am human still um.. *Audience laughing* *Pewds has the mind of a Reddit detective* *Chuckles* *INHALE* [Felix] Let's keep watching. [Video] BUT UM- But it- but it was just reffering to myself in the past. Um.
(STOP WITH THOSE UM'S PLEASE) Not that I was not human- I was just referring to myself in the p (quietly) *ast* (what does it mean??)
*Really really softly* Now that sort of thing doesn't just SLIP out of your tongue, okay Mark? All right? ""I was human"" That just doesn't happen Normally, okay? You just don't- You just don't simply say stuff That you're not supposed to say like Uhh.. Horrifically offensive words, That are genuinely frowned upon by the entirety of Humankind except them- Okay, all right. Well. It just DOESN'T HAPPEN MARK I Need answers.. [Video] But it is gonna bother you because you're human, And I was human, I am human still
*What do you mean.* *Audience laughing at Mark's words* but- [Felix] They cut away to the audience, You know they they- have his drone sitting in the back- OH GAWD OH GAWD x2 [Felix] WE'VE HAVE A CODE RED OVER HERE What is it that your hiding from us,Mark-e succ? Why is your laptop webcam taped over with your microphone? Is it so that during your shedding period? People won't find out? (loominarty) well, I know because from one reptile to another I mean from one part.. *burp* I know, okay. I just know I have sources--I have a reliable sources That's telling me that you're a reptile Okay, this is a really great channel that analyzes body language. Let's see what they have to say about the succ so for me The thing that I was really fascinated by it it always have been is um People right and how people work um you notice"" we're gonna go back I didn't expect it to cut off from his body you see how he's sitting straight up Hands on his knees head up chin level. Where as opposed to this guy who's mirroring Mark? He slightly angled down in the face, so he's submitting to Mark. He's covering. He's open. He's dominating the space and he is Purposely doing this and we'll I'll show you how I know is People right and how people work In orders in college. I studied psychology and computer science very long intense eye contact He's purposely doing it looks away shortly purposely doing that as well thoughts come through it gives a break But is to dominate ""and you know one of the things that you learn when you study psychology is That there are all these parts of the brain Which are geared"" say how long he's holding that eye contact now normally when you have someone who's submitting to you And you're still continuously dominating them in the fashion that he's doing right now with his body posture his intense eye contact You're going to give them a break and relax your body so that they can relax and be relaxed as well so it's a relaxed atmosphere"" It really feels like I'm I'm We're breaking down and it's some sort of alien life-form here. Okay. That's been trained to mimic human behavior a lot of stuff happened along the way, I think um You know there were real learning points and turning"" and now we see the sweat, and that's one of the few things It's really hard to control."" No no he doesn't sweat. He doesn't, he doesn't sweat come on. Let's get real here *Mark Zuckerberg,with the mind of a normie,tries to know what the Z         U        C      C meme is* What's the whole Z U C C thing? *Pewds laugh* Well, he's talking about oral sex Good morning Jarvis good morning mark. It's Saturday So you only have five meetings room temperature is set to a cool 68 degrees Earlier this year, I started building a simple AI to help run our home I talked to Jarvis using this app I built it uses artificial intelligence to understand me and figure out what to do Max woke up a few minutes ago. I'm entertaining her all right. Let's go check on her Practice our man Jarvis your Mandarin is so soothing. Jarvis also helps me get ready in the morning.""fresh shirt!"" ""Fire in the hole!"" Hell yeah. and Jarvis can play all of our favourite music. Hey play us some good Nickelback songs"" ""I'm sorry Mark. I'm afraid I can't do that There are no good Nickelback song"" Good! that was actually a test all Nickelback sucks. Am I right everyone HEHEHE Yeah, Nickelback is the worst.ohoho *Pewds laughs weirdly* Nickelback sucks Oh they're the worst I hate them because everyone else hates them ahahaha. Have you heard of my Crocs? Haha? Who would wear them? Am I rite ahahaha I can't think for myself ahahaha *HEHEHEHEHEHE* Anyway, I talked to Jarvis using this app I built it uses artificial intelligence to understand and figure out what to do. Jarvis also Helps me get ready in the morning ""Fresh shirt!""  ""Fire in the hole!"" And Jarvis can play all of our favorite music. Okay, how about just play some songs that our whole family likes *Excision - Robo Kitty appears* And if I don't want to talk, I could just text Jarvis through a messenger bot that I built What the hell ya doing Z U C C My bad auughh.... I think my favorite part of Mark is sense of humor. It's truly I-It's something Hey, welcome to F8!

7Lq3_rsBJ9w,now over the next few months we'll be celebrating inspirational women from around the world with a series of exclusive interviews and our first guest today has been making waves internationally after she became a whistleblower on the chinese government over their handling of the covet 19 pandemic now back in december dr li men yan a top scientist working in hong kong was tasked with looking into a cluster of virus cases which we now know to be coronavirus she claims she discovered a cover-up operation and that the chinese government knew about the spread of the virus before publicly acknowledging the outbreak determined to share her findings with the world she was allegedly forced to flee to the u.s for her own safety and it's from a secret location that she joins us today dr yan thank you so much for joining us it's an incredible story that you have to tell and like we say you were you're a scientist you're a virologist you were working at the hong kong school of public health and it was back in december you were asked to study a cluster of this unknown virus cases and coming out of wuhan to be precise what did you discover in those early days hi good morning thanks for having me so first let me briefly introduce the whole thing from the beginning so i'm the medical doctor and also phd who work in the university of hong kong school of public health in the who reference lab for both influenza and later the new coronal virus so basically i work with a bunch of the top corner virus and also emerging disease experts in the world and because i have got my two degrees from mainland china and i'm the only one who can speak in mandarin there so i'm the one from the call team a son to is a son to go to do the sacred investigation about the new pneumonia in wuhan and back to the in december 31 december last year so from during my uh investigation which lasted until uh twice from early january and december january to the second time the mid january what i have found is actually a report to my supervisor who's a uh who consultant but there is no response from who and from them because everyone warned me that don't cross the right line and don't uh um keep the sign keep silence if not i will get dispaired so finally on 17th january i know i have to tell it to people because it's urgent and then i tend to contact a very famous chinese youtuber based in you us mr muther and delivers a 5k pawn to him which was the first time it was told to the world but is in chinese that is first china government was discovering the uh kobe 19 uh uh situation the second thing is uh the whole uh situation is human to human transmission already exists the third thing is saskaway 2 is a high mutant virus and it will become the outbreak soon if no control the fourth thing is the seafood market in wuhan and all the intermediate hosts these are the uh smoke screen and the final thing aids this virus is not from nature this is based on the china military institute discovered and owned some bad chronovirus named cc45 and zxc21 based on that afterlab modification becomes the novovirus so sorry doctor dr jennifer i interrupt just a second just to be clear you're saying we we've all been told we've all heard about these these um wet markets and the seafood market and the reclaimed certainly from the beginning that this is where it started you genuinely in your scientific beliefs you don't believe that's where it came from at all no i have my intelligence from the cdc's in china from the local doctors from doctors and other people around china so also based on my evidence i work on vaccine and also biology immunology in the university of hong kong all these things get together clearly shown and now get verified these are the truths all the other things are covered where does it come from then it comes from the lab the lab in wuhan and the mob is controlled by china is it not virtually impossible though to to definitively prove that uh yes actually i kept doing it from january even before i leave hong kong at that time i didn't expose myself but now my scientific report worked with a small group of top scientists in the world in u.s it will come to the world soon very soon i can tell you we are going to publish it there are two reports the first one will come in several days okay and it will tell people evidence all the scientific evidence and when you spoke out did you worry about your safety oh actually from the beginning i decided to deliver this message out it was very scary at that time but i know that's the thing i have to do because i'm the doctor i'm the scientist i cannot see it happen i know if i don't tell the truth to the world i will be regretful and i will move the capacity for myself to tell the truth in the future and and how did you manage to leave and get to safety yeah so as i said mr luda in u.s he is a director of the board of the rule of owl foundation which is a foundation based in new york and try to help those anti-china government people who reveal the truth to the world so i contacted him and i kept working with him behind to tell the truth until late of april china government targeted me and they basically tried to make me despair i got the information from mr luda and the foundation and him helped me to manage to gather educate and also help me secretly run away from hong kong and the justice league foreign what did they do to try to make you disappear so this is some common sense for our chinese people under the china government we know that basically like for example to me what they have done is studied all my information uh especially those things positive for me and also they recruit people like cyber military to spread the rumors for me for example they said i'm an ayah i'm the one who knew nothing just keep hamster in the lab and also they make up my eyes to cover it up and they control my friend they control my family life threatening things finally everyone has to admit even i'm not existing that's not how it happened to hong kong those people despaired in the movement from last year the same thing sorry to interrupt i just wondered i mean you've had to now sacrifice your family your friends and it's a massive sacrifice to make that you that you've chosen to do can i ask what made you make that decision okay so uh actually i never thought it would have happened i mean yes when i did the secret investigation i just thought i should get response to my supervisor and they will do the right thing on behalf of the government and also who but what i say by deeply investigation is no one responds to that people are scared of the government and they are waiting to collaborate with china government and who to get more benefits to become safe but this is something as i say urgent at that time chinese new year time big transportation from wuhan to china to all over the world this is a high contentious dangerous virus all these things make me cannot keep silence i mean this is for human being for global health that's what i have to do also face to face threatening i just want to deliver message as much as possible before i get this paired dr yang we're running out of time i just want to ask you very quickly can you give us a little sneak exclusive preview of what you're going to publish in a few days give us a world exclusive yeah it's like the genome sequence is like our human fingerprint so based on this you can recognize identify this this thing so i use the evidence exists in the genome sequence of saskari to to tell people why this is come from the lab in china why they are the only one who made it and also uh you everyone who even have no biology knowledge you can read it and you can check and identify verify by yourself this is the critical thing for us to know the origins of the virus if not we cannot overcome it it will be the life threatening for everyone in our life thank you excellent doctor and thank you i wish we had more time with you and we hopefully will try and get you back because there's many more questions we'd love to ask you but thank you so much for joining us today thank you dr jian obviously we spoke about the chinese government there we talked about um who we obviously have replies from all of those on the claim the chinese government knew about the virus and tried to conceal it the director of the chinese national health commission says the fact is that there's no delay or cover-up whatsoever by the chinese government it reported virus data and related information as soon as possible to the international community on the claims they knew about person-to-person transmission the national health commission says as soon as cases were identified in wuhan city china acted immediately to conduct investigations to stop the spread of the disease and china and have also denied that the outbreak of the virus originated in the lab saying that the world health organization have said multiple times there is no evidence the new coronavirus was created in a laboratory this has also been dismissed by the u.s national intelligence office ,3
elf6h_K4JH0,clearly when you did this rally you would have known that you were breaking the law technically did that bother you uh well that isn't right we had a lot of ongoing discussions with the police and everything was okay and they agreed to um enable our rally to end in a march to downing street so there was completely no problem at all uh we are a political rally and those are allowed however at the last minute a different group of policemen turned up and arrested me and when i was in the van i asked them what is going on and they indicated let's say that this came from on high so as far as we can see is a political decision to arrest me whereas allowing a black lives matter uh event at the same time or or further done that down into parliament square allow that to happen what was the reason what was the reason given to you yeah i mean you raised an interesting point i'm not really sure why you're being singled out uh for a ten thousand pound fight when there have clearly been a lot of other mass protests what was the reason given to you absolutely as to why you have been targeted when as you said so many black lives matter protests have taken place yeah anyone being fine peter's uh peers interesting talking appears to be yeah we don't meet many other people no they didn't give i actually have a brother i have a brother called jeremy to make things even more weird that's good no they they didn't give a reason as to why i was singled out and i think you uh peers should challenge sadiq khan to explain why he's got political policing in london now and also challenge him if it's not political allow us to have another rally on the 26th of september just before parliament okay well i would say i would say i don't understand i don't understand why you've been single again 26th of september yeah on that point i can uh agree with you it seems irrational and unfair but should we look at that and we will lastly let's get to what you were actually protesting about do you believe the coronavirus do you believe the coronavirus pandemic is real well there's various views on this i mean some some doctors say uh that actually what we're seeing is some sort of flu that's been around for 46 years and others say well uh it doesn't exist at all there isn't actually a virus what's your view everything which happens is exaggerated well let me well uh what we're doing is we're challenging the government to give actual evidence that there is a virus and we've given them until the fifth of september to reply to show understand the prime minister himself was hospitalized with the virus how much more evidence do you need well was he hospitalized with the virus or was he ill from something else you see there's a lot of claims going on uh and of course there might have been something happening in the past you're suggesting the british prime minister invented okay just to clarify you are suggesting the british prime minister invented having a virus that may not exist i don't know if anyone in invented it or not but i would say that uh the numbers of people getting whatever they're getting is declining rapidly and there's no justification whatsoever mr corbin let me just jump in just to clarify the numbers 25 million people around the world have tested positive for chronovirus covert 19. well yeah and over 800 yeah let me finish the question then i will let you ask this don't work do not worry let me finish the question and overdose don't interrupt me i won't i'll let you answer over 800 000 people have now died from covet 19. that is a demonstrable fact now what part of that do you think does not constitute a pandemic well 800 000 people have died and they've been labelled covid when it might have been completely something else it is not a pandemic because the numbers dying are nothing different from a normal year of people dying as they die all the time and secondly it is not a high consequence infectious disease and that was declared by the government and the world health organization on march the 19th so what we have is a psychological operation a psychological operation to close down the economy in the interests of mega corporations more than 40 000 people have died in this country as a result of covid directly people are dying pharmaceutical companies listen well it is boosting pharmaceutical companies and and big telecom who are making billions and billions out of this while the ordinary british worker is going to the wall losing jobs if those pharma companies are coming up with treatment that can help people who are suffering and potentially find a vaccine that can prevent long-term illness there's no need for a vaccine that isn't no no no no vaccines cause death history of that listen to me listen to me you're interrupting you're interrupting the history of the recent modern vaccines shows they make people more ill there is already a cure for these covered symptoms namely chloroquine and zinc so there's no need because you the viewers are paying for it mr corbin if you may let me jump in what are you telling me about how your clock's glorious it's not a cure for covid19 that's a complete lie it's not a cure no the doctors who've done it have said so and it works no they haven't there's no evidence i don't mind you coming on and talking about these things but if you're going to state bold lies like hydroxychloroquine 19 that is simply not true i'm relying on expert doctors on expert doctors say this and i suggest what you say isn't true you're relying on conspiracy theorists listen to doctors conspiracy theory when you've got nothing to say okay on vaccines what happened with what happened with measles if vaccines don't work yes these are earlier type of vaccines i'm talking about modern vaccines did it work the vaccine for measles did it work um it might well have worked but the vaccines of the past are different from the ones now which have many additives which are in general dangerous and the statistics show that more people get lower immune systems when they've had that okay let's bring in doctor hillary someone who is an extrovert doctor who may be very concerned frankly about what you're saying dr hillary um extremely dangerous to corbyn and his statements are littered with errors absolutely littered with dangerous errors the hydroxychloroquine and zinc for example completely dissed by hundreds of different experts let me tell you about the virus the virus has been identified by the electron microscope we have sequenced the entire ribonucleic acid genome so we know exactly that this is a new virus it has nothing to do with viruses that we've seen in the last 40 years all of your statements are not only dangerous let me tell you about modern vaccine you say that the old vaccines could have worked and they absolutely did work measles for example we saw 460 000 cases every year of measles before vaccination after that we saw 130 a reduction of 99.9 percent we're talking meningitis which kills 10 of people was introduced the vaccine was introduced in 1999 quite recently and we saw numbers decreased from 883 to 28 more than that a reduction of 97 and a huge reduction in mortality you are dangerous you shouldn't be preaching you're not medically qualified i don't know where you get your rubbish fake news and you shouldn't be honest the real uh that i think probably i think you probably nailed it dr hillary about modern vaccines modern vaccines work very well meningococcal meningitis go and have a look at this so-called testing here's corbin let me ask you this let me ask you this question do you believe his dna and rna rather than finding let me ask you another question mr corbin i understand maybe one that maybe give them a chance yeah mrs corbyn do you believe there is a link between 5g masts uh and covet well that's the question is not correctly posed the important thing to understand is that electromagnetic radiation 4g 5g and and you know normal wi-fi which is mostly 4g do lower your immune systems and the statistics show very clearly and this is proven by objective tesco and over years that those things do indeed it's actually completed what you've just said is what you've just said no with this it's utter nonsense measurement so 5g is 66 times below the safety limit for harmful radiation meaning it is not strong enough to harm ourselves or have a negative effect on our immune system the important thing is not the amount of radiation the important thing is the frequency you're arguing just like the tobacco lobby we have a new tobacco lobby they said warm in your lungs doesn't matter it was the tar that mattered and the same thing with climate change is uh it's the frequency that matters and climate change is another hoax yeah man-made fossil fuels all the hoax everything made up well the the the sun the sun rules uh weather and climate and i can tell you that

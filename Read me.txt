- The complete code  is in the file named "Omer-Thesis-2035939.ipynb"

- download all the files and save it in a filder named "Omer-Thesis-2020".

- Upload the folder "Omer-Thesis-2020 " on your google drive.

- open the code on google colab.

- First mount your drive containing the data folder with the google colab. 

- Now you are ready to run the code.

- Make sure to download the "averaged_perceptron_tagger", "punkt","wordnet" and "stopwords" package from nltk.

- The code for the pre-processing is written as one single function.

- the previous data is in the files named "test_data.pickle.zip" and "training_data.pickle.zip"

- the data collected in the process of this thesis is in the two files named "data_team_a.csv" and "data_team_b.csv". 

- All the features are extracted through the TF-IDF approach. 

- Make sure that the correct google drive is mounted with the google colab. If all the modules and packages are installed correctly the script should run fine.

PVg2z5cJeBg,joining us now on the line from Sherbrooke Quebec dr. jacques pepin who is the author of a new book called the origins of AIDS and dr. Pippen we're happy to have you on TV Oh tonight come on tell you it's a pleasure to be here with you today thank you very much well we have known of course about AIDS I guess conventionally speaking for 30 years now but you think it goes back further how far back do you trace the origins of AIDS the current estimation is that the first person who was infected with the virus got it from a chimpanzee and that person probably was infected around 1921 so it's almost 100 years ago how did the infection take place the most likely scenario is that a hunter eventually got a chimpanzee in one of his straps and while cutting out the chimpanzee made so to be able to bring back pieces of the animal to the village that hunter got hurt he injured himself with a with his knife if it was not the hunter then maybe it was the unto his wife in the village while preparing the meat so that's the most likely scenario because several other hypotheses have been examined and can now be rejected firmly so it's the only scenario that and that remains plausible now in which country do you think this took place in the the source of HIV one is chimpanzee a specific subspecies of chimpanzee which inhabits a limited part of Central Africa so that includes certain Cameroon a small part of the Central African Republic Congo Brazzaville Gabon and Equatorial Guinea's so the the very first person who started the pandemic was certainly certainly living in one of these countries and let me take us off the path just for a second here because you said HIV one which may be news for some people you you have them broken down into HIV 1 and 2 what's the difference well HIV 2 is virus which remained limited to some parts of West Africa so about two or three thousand kilometers away from the region where HIV 1 emerged the source of HIV 2 is a different primate it's actually a small monkey called the [ __ ] mangabey and the the virus is less pathogenic than HIV 1 and it's also less transmissible so if you look at the whole the old the old world about 99 percent of cases of AIDS are caused by HIV 1 and only 1 percent at most are caused by HIV 2 ok let's get back on the path now and let's return to Africa and have you tell us how you think colonial Africa's history played into the spread of AIDS and there were two factors that in my opinion played a substantial role and they were both related to the colonization of Central Africa so the first one was the urbanization of that part of the world the colonial power is created cities in which for several reasons there was a very substantial excess in the number of adult men compared to the number of adult women and the consequence of that which was predictable was the development of urban prostitution so that facilitated the sexual transmission of HIV one in the cities the other factor which was at least as important and perhaps even more important was the development of medical interventions for the control of a small number of tropical diseases so what happened is that the colonizing powers had mobile teams that visited each and every village twice a year they would try to find out everybody who had given a small number of infectious diseases and the people who were found to be to have these infectious diseases they were treated right there in the village with drugs that were administered intravenously and at the time the medical doctors were not aware that viruses could be transmitted through Salinger's and needles so the sterilization was inadequate and of course the syringes and needles were consistently constantly reused on a you know on a number of patients every day and there was certainly some transmission of HIV one through this mode of transmission iatrogenic infection well doctor Pippin let me actually read an excerpt from your book which follows up on what you just said you wrote I do not believe that transmission via medical interventions plays an important role in HIV dynamics today and I agree with the experts who maintain that it contributes to less than 5% of recent HIV infections although even a single case is unacceptable however I became convinced that transmission during health care contributed to the simultaneous emergence of hiv-1 and hiv-2 in different parts of the African continent 50 to 75 years ago and I gather you conclude that you yourself must have played a personal role in the spread of AIDS how so well I worked in the the Congo in the early 1980s for four years the country was then known as as a year I work in a small Hospital about five hundred kilometers northeast of Kinshasa and at the time of course HIV was not yet known but the the hepatitis B virus was known what I can say is that the time there was no preoccupation among the medical officers or among the a nursing personnel there was no preoccupation towards the potential transmission of viruses through syringes and needles what happened practically was that I was supervising a network of about 20 health centers which were located in small villages there was no electricity in these villages and the to sterilize the syringes and needles because we didn't have single-use syringes and needles at the time to sterilize the we just put into a small container with the tablet of formal and the the the vapor of formal that persisted in the container was certainly enough to kill the bacteria but I'm not sure that it was good enough to kill the viruses in in the hospital itself usually the sterilization of syringes and needles was pretty good but they were periods of time when there was no electricity for up to two months at a time and then we just the only way we could sterilize the syringes and needles was through the boiling but a data at the time like all other medical officers working in the country I was not preoccupied with the transmission of viruses and I didn't pay attention to how long the the actual boiling took place so it's it's plausible that a few patients under my care were infected with HIV through these injections well tell me whether we're still using the same drugs for the treatment of sleeping sickness we were using the same drugs that had been use in the 1920's 1930's and all of these drugs had to be given intravenously I don't mean to get all personal on with you here but you know that a doctor's first job is of course do no harm how does one live with the knowledge that you know that you may be responsible for having harmed patients well I guess that's a part of medicine and the you know eventually you kind of look at the the whole picture and if I look at the health care that was provided in that hospital during the four years I worked there I think overall the the health care saved the lives of certainly several hundreds and perhaps more so you know one has to accept that they can be negative effects fail care in some cases and that's that's that was unfortunate and I think there's there's a lesson from that story which I tell in the book which most of it actually took place much before I worked in the in the Congo is that we should be we being the medical profession and scientists in general we should be a bit more prudent when we manipulate nature in a way that we do not fully understand understood alright let's continue telling the story then of how aids started as you believed in central Africa but somehow made its way over to this hemisphere how do you think that happened what probably happened is in 1960 the Congo became independent rapidly there was a civil war within that country the Belgian doctors and teachers and nurses all left very suddenly and so to replace to replace these people the United Nations at first and eventually the Congolese government I heard several thousand a Asian teachers about four and a half thousand of them actually work in the Congo and lived there for at least a few years and the most likely scenario is that one of them and only one of them got infected with HIV brought it back to Haiti perhaps when this person went back for a vacation in his own country or perhaps see when they are permanently then there was some local transmission with an AAT and a few years later and it took just a few years the virus was eventually reacts ported through to the United States and there is a fair amount of evidence which suggests that this exportation from eighty to the US occurred through sexual tourism and all of that all these years later has led to more than sixty million people around the world being infected with HIV do you sometimes shake your head and and wonder how this one case began all of this misery it's really an incredible story is it about 65 million people actually have been infected and about half of them so 32 or 33 million so far up died so it's really I agree it's really an incredible story and it was at the beginning it wasn't a very unlikely scenario but in the book I try to explain the different the different factors which which are loud this pandemic to develop now you have put forward I gather what much of the medical community considers to be a very contrary theory to what we've been operating with for the past thirty years what's been what's been the conventional wisdom about how HIV and AIDS have spread since 30 years ago well the book addresses the the history of HIV before 1980 in 1981 is the year that the disease was first described and until my own book was published it was only a single book which addressed that part of the history of hiv/aids that book which which is called the river supported the theory that the origin of AIDS was caused by the contamination of an experimental vaccine against poliomyelitis the author speculated that chimpanzees cells had been used for the preparation of that vaccine and now there is ample evidence and there is a section in the book where I review these studies which were done after the publication of that book there is ample evidence that this did not happen some old vials of that experimental vaccines were actually located didn't contain any HIV and they didn't contain any DNA from chimpanzees so that theory can be rejected so now my book tries to assemble all different parts of the puzzle from that first case in 1921 until the the the disease was eventually recognized in 1981 what happened in the subsequent 30 years I don't want to give you the impression that injections that miracle injections played a substantial role I think after that most of the transmission was was sexual of course heterosexual and a more sexual intercourse it was some transmission among drug addicts so the that was transmission through injections but I think that after 1981 for several reasons the number of cases who got infected through medical injections much decreased but as you as I've written in the introduction and as you just mentioned I think that even a single case during health care now that we know about the virus about its its modes of transmission I think that's unacceptable and we should everything that's possible to try to avoid this you have certainly put a different theory out there and the medical world is starting to consider what you've put out there do you think the medical world is starting to accept your theory as opposed to the one it's been operating with for the past thirty years yes I think so far the book has been well accepted now of course it was published a few weeks ago so it's only will take some time before the book is is is read and criticized by a number of people I'm of course willing to accept criticism you know when you try to describe history which a story which began about 100 years ago in very isolated areas of Central Africa you've got to accept that there is a margin of error on some of the estimates which I've made in the book so I'm not pretending that it is 100% accurate but I think 90% I would I would be confident of that I think one of the areas where there is some imprecision is actually the date of that very first person infected I told you it was most likely to be 1921 but there is a margin of error so it's 19 19 21 plus or minus 10 years so it's possible that within the few years if additional studies are published maybe that that date of the very first case may change a little bit by a few years the confidence and interval on that may narrow narrow down but I don't think that would change substantially the various scenarios which I've explained in the book okay let me ask you one last question and that is you're at the university of sherbrooke in quebec you're not at the Centers for Disease Control you're not at UCLA you're not at some fancy University in France or England or Germany or whatever and you've put out this quite astonishing new theory that is capturing a lot of attention what's it like well the I think the the reason I was I was able to put that that story together was that I had worked in Africa for a number of years that that I had worked on sleeping sickness for many many years so I was aware of the treatments which had been used in the colonial era then I also worked on HIV control projects in Africa for a long time these were projects funded by cedar the Canadian International Development Agency so I did a lot of work with sex workers in in in Africa for many many years so I I can pretend that I know a lot about prostitution I think the fact that I I'm a francophone enabled me to read all these reports of the colonial era because the story took place in French and Belgian colonies so through all these various events in my personal professional life I was able eventually to to put the story together understood dr. jacques pepin we thank you very much for joining us on the line from Sherbrooke Quebec merci beaucoup it was a pleasure ,1
hgcQfIt1kqw,"Shari Lewis a singer and AIDS educator has been hiv-positive for almost 25 years I went for the blood test for my marriage license and three weeks later on April 12th 1987 my 33rd birthday three months before my wedding day the doctor called and told me on the phone that I was in fact positive urine at that time it was practically a death sentence once the first time I encountered patients with HIV was during my residency training in Boston in 1985 most of the patients had very advanced disease and we didn't have any treatment people didn't make it out of the hospital in the late spring of 1981 on my desk was the June 5th issue of morbidity and mortality weekly report five gay men from Los Angeles very very sick with a pneumonia that you only see in people who are immunosuppressed one month later was the second report of 26 individuals again curiously all gay men from LA San Francisco and New York all presenting with this unusual syndrome of not only Pneumocystis pneumonia but several of them had Kaposi sarcoma and I can remember thinking my goodness this is something really new and really scary physicians even in infectious diseases and an internal medicine were quite afraid the first patient that was admitted the reaction of the staff to this individual was as if he were carrying smallpox it was not recognized at all at the time of the New England Journal of Medicine paper in late 1981 for the potential seriousness of what it really was it was very frustrating because we were seeing multiple infections in a single individual in a fashion that was just overwhelming and disfiguring we had a deal with end-of-life issues on a regular basis to make matters worse the disease carried a terrible social stigma because it was seen most commonly in gay men and IV drug users people would say well you know you deserve this for this terrible life that you're leading there was a lot of bad stuff there with regard to stigma intolerance insensitivity to what these people were going through the CDC established in 1982 that the virus was transmitted sexually and by infected blood to drug users and hemophiliacs but that didn't stop the speculation misinformation and fear people believe HIV was transmitted by mosquitoes or toilet seats or by kissing or eating utensils or drinking from people's water glasses all sorts of things in 1984 French and American researchers discovered the cause of AIDS it was a retrovirus they called human immunodeficiency virus or HIV that attacked the immune system and integrated into the genome of our cd4 cells within a year a blood test for AIDS was developed it revealed that the virus could lay dormant for years suggesting that we were seeing just the tip of the iceberg even those of us who are in it from day one were shocked by the enormity of the problem by this time AIDS was spreading exponentially in developing countries my first experience with HIV as a vision really happened when I was a medical student in 1986 I was shuttling between Harvard and Haiti at the time and the epidemic had hit the urban areas before we knew it you know we had patients of our own from central Haiti it was a very different epidemiology than what we saw in the United States AIDS was incapacitating to men and women and especially women was clear that it was more readily transmitted from men to women than women to men the stigma of AIDS was different in the developing world as well way beyond the question of its mode of transmission there is always a stigma associated with any wasting consumptive disease that takes young lives farmer and his colleagues at Partners in Health had to beg for resources to care for the AIDS patients and their families coming to his clinics people would say well you can't throw money at it well please you know throw some just cold hard cash because that could bring in human resources and help build up health systems in spite of the evidence of the growing severity of the epidemic in the US and globally the federal government was slow to respond President Reagan didn't even mention the word for years and years and years thousands of people had died the gay and hiv-infected communities mobilised to demand care and affordable access to the first HIV drug AZT the AIDS coalition to unleash power act-up took to the streets they did some outrageous things that are now part of the manual of activists activities if you listened to what they were saying they were really making sense they were developing drugs and those folks who stood the benefit the most from the drugs had no role of influence that process we decided that we were going to force them to know that we were there and as a result of that we put a face stays and we refuse to go away and that really started off what turned out to be now intensive involvement of activists and virtually every phase of what we do with HIV AIDS AZT extended lives but drug resistance always emerged by 1994 the number of AIDS cases in the US had surpassed 400,000 AIDS had become the leading cause of death in Americans ages 25 to 44 and pregnant women infected with the virus were passing it on to their babies one of the biggest breakthroughs in the history of HIV prevention is signified by AIDS clinical trials group or ACTG o 7-6 if you treat a pregnant woman with AZT during the pregnancy and during delivery and then treat the baby for a certain period of time you can dramatically decrease the likelihood of transmissibility the OSM e6 trial was a bit of a personal epiphany for me because a lot of the debate back then was about prevention versus care the debate was where should we put our resources since we don't have treatment then we put them all into prevention but again that made it sound like we had good prevention technologies which we didn't wear was no vaccine the main prevention strategies included condoms which were usually controlled by men and so called abstinence approaches so along comes Oh seven six at oh seven six is about a drug the use of AZT to prevent mother-to-child transmission introduced HIV drugs to the developing world and was the first truly effective step in combating aids in resource-poor settings but there was still no durable treatment Phil Wilson had been diagnosed with AIDS in 1982 they're often days when I would spend the morning taking care of my partner followed by a doctor's appointment for my own health followed by visiting another friend and a hospice care followed by attending a funeral followed by a rally followed by preparing for a meeting with a policy maker or an elective issue followed by taking care of my partner yen in the early 90s researchers were making progress approaching the virus from multiple directions do one drug like AZT it was good for a short while to suppress the virus and then the virus figured out a way to escape it so it was very clear that we had I get combinations of different targets trials involving several antiretroviral drugs targeting the viruses protease enzyme began in the mid 90s word of these promising agents spread rapidly through the HIV community finally a string of breakthroughs the AIDS clinical trial group 320 was the first study to show the full clinical benefit of highly active antiretroviral therapy heart while we were very actively clinically testing different combinations of drugs we reached the point where for the most part the virus couldn't escape that you kind of boxed it in I was involved in some of these trials as a site investigator and when we started to see the patient's clinical status improving it wasn't so clear what was happening but after patients had been on the study for four to six months we really started to notice that nobody was getting sick many of us experienced that Lazarus syndrome where we were on death's door I was in the intensive care unit and a coma and the doctors had given me less than 24 hours to live I went on heart and got better and the rest I guess is history in the making access to proper care and treatment but the drugs were expensive and it was hard to get them to the developing world so he went to the manufacturers of the drug and said you know give us a hand help us out and a number of drug companies did get involved so we went from 10,000 dollars per patient a year to about 1,200 it wasn't until we went to the generic manufacturers and said we need not just thousands of people and care we need millions and that's what really permitted the scale-up that's under hundred dollars per patient per year those steps have saved millions of lives I've had now a number of patients born with HIV who are adults and I have children of their own and did not pass on HIV to their children there was no possibility of putting millions of dying people on therapy without the Global Fund and PEPFAR President's Emergency Plan for AIDS relief people really surprised when the Bush administration decided to launch the largest global health effort in history dr. Tony Fauci was working with the White House to make a plan but first it had to get passed the Office of Management and Budget he called a small group together including Paul Farmer to go to Washington to make the case he said I'm sending you in to the White House as my expert witnesses and you know I thought it sounds scary to me but we knew what we were doing was right it's just that we had so little experience and Tony knew that if PEPFAR became a major program that we could break that cycle of poverty and disease and strengthen health systems which is not a very attractive sexy thing to fund but critical to survival of lots of people with other problems beyond AIDS the meeting was held in late 2002 when we said but we know it'll work we've already done it we have people come back from the dead then the White House staff said well but that's because you're an infectious disease doctor and I said no no this is care delivered by community health workers and my Haitian colleagues I would say that that small cohort of first patients from Haiti had a big impact challenges remain in the developing world only half of the 410 million people infected with HIV who should receive antiretroviral therapy are actually getting it in Los Angeles 90% of judi couriers patients are doing well on their treatment Shari Lewis started antiretroviral therapy in 1997 when she began to have sim it changed the direction of my life which of course was supposed to be a very short one but thankfully it's been a full life that you know they've been everything some of the complications that we see in our patients who've had HIV for a long time are things like osteoporosis cardiovascular disease we're trying to sort out really to what extent these are due to the normal aging process or due to side effects of HIV medications or chronic HIV infection any other questions still the progress in the last 30 years is undeniable the AIDS story is actually a success story and I'm not sure everybody knows that it's a scientific success it's a development success and it's a delivery success we've delivered the medicines now we haven't done it good and well enough but I think it's huge that you have millions of people on therapy for a chronic disease that afflicts mostly poor people there's no other example of that yet you you ",1
izwomieBwG0,"Here at SciShow, we talk a lot about the fascinating,
complicated, and often very weird stories of discovery and collaboration that led to
the science we know today. But one of the strangest is something we haven't
covered in much detail before, and it's a biggie: the decades it took to figure out
exactly what HIV and AIDS were, and how to prevent and treat them. Since the start of the AIDS crisis, some 70
million people have been infected with HIV, and 35 million of those people have died. Both those numbers are staggering in their
own way, and together, they tell the story of a disease that has led to an incredible
amount of loss, but also one that — if you’re lucky enough to have access to the right medicines
— is no longer a death sentence. So, in honor of World AIDS Day on December
1, we want to tell you that story. There’s a lot to cover, so we’ll do it
in two parts. This episode, we’ll go over how we figured
out what HIV is, when the infection morphs into AIDS, and where we think the virus came
from. Next time, we’ll look back to the earliest
treatments, the arrival of antiretroviral drugs, which were complete game-changers,
and go over the creative ways scientists are now thinking about prevention and possibly
even a cure. But first, the basics. HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus, is a
retrovirus that infects immune cells, most notably what are known as CD4 T cells. The “retrovirus” part just means that
the virus uses RNA — DNA’s more wily, less stable cousin — as its genetic material,
and that once HIV infects a cell, it makes a DNA version of its genome with a special
enzyme, then inserts that DNA into the host genome. If that sounds sneaky — well, it is. And it’s part of why HIV has been so difficult
to treat, which we'll talk about more next time. Now, those CD4 T cells that HIV infects and
ultimately kills are a kind of white blood cell known as ‘helper’ T cells. When they recognize a threat, they pump out
proteins that help coordinate a bunch of different immune responses. You definitely want them around. HIV is spread by bodily fluids, including
blood, semen, vaginal fluid, and breast milk. That’s why HIV can be transmitted through
sex, dirty needles, breastfeeding, and any other swapping of fluids you might do — with
a major exception: saliva isn’t one of those fluids. Saliva is full of other stuff that prevents
HIV from being infectious, like antibodies and a bunch of antimicrobial proteins. So unless there’s a lot of blood in your
saliva for some reason, it can't transmit HIV. When someone is first infected, they might
feel like they have a bout of the flu, with a fever, headache, rash, sore throat, and
muscle and joint pain. That’s because the virus is infecting lots
of cells and the immune system is trying to fight it off. But within a few weeks those symptoms pass
because by then the person has specific antibodies that can keep the virus from running totally
rampant. After that, they usually feel fine for a long
time — in many cases, a really long time, like several decades. Until, one day, they don’t, because the
virus has finally killed off too many T cells, leaving the body unable to properly defend
itself against pathogens — anything that might be dangerous or infectious. That’s when someone is said to have AIDS,
or acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Usually AIDS is diagnosed once the person’s
T cell count falls below 200 cells per microliter of blood, which is well below the normal 500-1500,
or if they develop what's called an opportunistic infection. These are infections that anyone with a reasonably
strong immune system would be able to fight off, easy-peasy. But because HIV has obliterated most of their
T cells, AIDS patients get sick. And, they can die. Most of the time it’s an opportunistic infection
that killed them. So, some of that was probably familiar to
you, but pretend for a moment that you’ve never heard of HIV or anything else I just
mentioned. Because back in the ‘80s, we didn’t know
these basic facts. All doctors knew was that suddenly, healthy
young gay men were developing extremely rare infections and cancers — and, it was killing
them. One of the first people to notice the pattern
was an immunologist at UCLA. Between the fall of 1980 and the following
spring, he saw a string of five patients, all gay men in their 20s or 30s, with an unusual
kind of pneumonia. There was a fungus growing inside their lungs. Normally, the fungus was totally harmless
and would never infect the lungs, but in these men it had, and it was making it hard for
them to breathe. The patients also had oral thrush — basically
yeast infections in their mouths — and few CD4 T cells. By June, when the immunologist wrote up the
results for the CDC’s weekly Mortality and Morbidity report, two patients had died. A month later, a dermatologist in New York
chimed in with a similarly disturbing report, this time with Kaposi’s sarcoma, a rare
cancer where patients develop blotchy purple lesions on their skin. In two and a half years, 26 young gay men
in New York and LA had been diagnosed with Kaposi’s. Some also had the weird fungal pneumonia,
and 8 had died. It’s hard to imagine now, but at this point,
scientists had no idea what was making people sick. They didn’t know if it was some sort of
toxin or a pathogen. And if it was an infection of some kind, they
didn’t know how it was spreading. That meant they couldn’t warn people about
how to protect themselves. The association with gay men, though, was
certainly striking, and early on, many called the mystery disease GRID, for gay-related
immune deficiency. Lots of people would talk about it as the
“gay cancer” or “gay plague.” But the disease wasn’t limited to gay men. It was turning up in hemophiliacs — people
whose blood doesn't clot properly and are treated with clotting factors taken from other
people’s blood. Doctors were also seeing cases in IV drug
users, women, infants, and heterosexual men. In particular, 20 recent immigrants from Haiti
had gotten sick, and none said they were gay. Those clues were important, because they told
scientists the disease — which had finally been given the name AIDS — was probably
infectious, and probably transmitted by blood. There were other diseases that spread in similar
ways, like hepatitis B. So in March of 1983, the CDC issued a warning
that doctors needed to be careful about blood transfusions, and that the disease seemed
to spread through both gay and straight sex. Debates about the specifics, including whether
it could spread through saliva, would happen later. But what was the infectious agent? The race was on for scientists to figure out
what was causing the disease. French molecular biologist Luc Montagnier
suspected a virus because at the time, the blood products hemophiliacs used were filtered
for things like bacteria and fungi. But viruses were too small to catch. So along with his colleague Françoise Barré-Sinoussi,
he searched cells taken from AIDS patients and found a retrovirus. Around the same time, Robert Gallo at the
NIH in the US also identified a retrovirus in samples from AIDS patients. Both groups published their work in May 1983,
and shortly afterward another team found yet another retrovirus. All the viruses had been given different names,
and at first, it’s wasn’t totally obvious that they were the same thing. But they were, and in 1986, the cause of AIDS
had been given an official name: HIV. So, HIV was the problem, but where had it
come from, and why had the epidemic struck now, in the decade of big hair and Michael
Jackson? While some researchers were scrambling to
identify whatever it was that made AIDS infectious, others noticed that macaque monkeys also seemed
to suffer from an AIDS-like disease. One group decided to take some blood samples
from these sick monkeys, and in 1985 they found a virus that was similar to HIV. It was eventually called SIV, for simian immunodeficiency
virus. Researchers started to think that HIV might
have come from our primate relatives, jumping the species barrier. After a lot of work, they figured out that
the virus behind the epidemic was very similar to the chimpanzee version of SIV, and they
were the ones who had passed it to us. But how exactly? There’s no real way to put this delicately,
but most scientists agree that the reason why SIV made the leap into humans — what’s
called a spillover — is because we had a taste for bushmeat, or wild game. In this case, monkeys and chimps. This is known as the cut-hunter hypothesis. In the course of butchering a chimpanzee,
some SIV-infected chimp blood enters a small cut on the hunter’s hand. Or, a bit of blood splatters in their mouth. The virus is close enough to human biology
to infect the hunter, and over time, if the hunter passes the virus along to enough people,
it evolves into the HIV we know today. Spillovers like these happened many times
— we can tell because the virus mutates quickly, and by looking at genetic differences,
we can identify multiple lineages of the virus, each one corresponding to a spillover. We’ve traced the current epidemic to just
one of these, called ‘M’ for main. By analyzing chimpanzee pee and poop, researchers
think the chimps who passed that version of the virus to us lived in southwestern Cameroon,
in the forests near the Congo. And based on the oldest blood samples we can
find that we now know have HIV in them, which are from 1959 and 1960, scientists estimate
that HIV-1 first infected humans around 1908. If that seems like a long time ago, well,
it takes a while for a virus to take off. By the 1920s, it’s thought that the virus
traveled downriver — in a person, of course — to the burgeoning city of Kinshasa, then
known as the Belgian colonial city of Leopoldville. There weren’t many women around other than
prostitutes, so experts think HIV spread that way, and possibly through injectable drugs
the colonists used to treat some tropical and venereal diseases. This was before disposable syringes, and nurses
were trying to treat lots of people with just a few of them, so the syringes may have only
been rinsed with alcohol before being used on the next patient. So the very methods meant to stop the spread
of disease may have actually been 
encouraging it. With time, infected people in Kinshasa left
to go to other places, and they did the unavoidable: they brought the virus with them. Because the virus mutates so quickly, we can
group the viruses into 9 different subtypes and get a sense of how HIV traveled around
the world from Central Africa. Several subtypes spread to other parts of
Africa. Subtype C went south and then landed in India. Subtype B went to Haiti — and then, through
several quirks of history, came to the US. First, in 1960, when the Belgians left the
Congo, French-speaking Haitians started to arrive in the Congo to work as doctors, lawyers,
and other professionals. But with the creation of Zaire in 1965, the
immigrants felt unwelcome, so they went back to Haiti, bringing HIV with them. There, HIV expanded especially quickly, possibly
because of a plasmapheresis center where people could get paid to donate their blood plasma. The center used a machine that mixed the blood
of different donors, allowing viruses to transfer. By 1982, nearly 8 percent of a group of young
mothers in a Port-au-Prince slum were HIV-positive — an astoundingly high number. HIV is thought to have entered the US around
1969, with just one infected person or unit of plasma from Haiti. It took about a decade for anyone to notice,
but by then it was too late. The epidemic had begun, and HIV was not only
in the Americas, but Europe and Asia, too. And now that it was here, we needed to figure
out how to fight it. But we'll get to that in the next episode
of this mini-series. In the meantime, thanks for watching this

7Y5-drxO08A,you know if you're done having kids you should also look into a vasectomy I'm never gonna do that just take away my manhood I got some partners that did that I might yo what if like that's what we're here for like as much as cuz I may not want kids today but what if I want to you could freeze your sperm yeah that's either that's to us so that's weird to me like I want the process well listen and I'm not I don't know you Mariah's personal business right but the majority of the celebrity twins see that there are done anything in vitro yeah yeah you use it using in feature like I said I don't know your situation and that'sthat's y'all business interesting because Pete I know everybody assume that with our kids but it was it was more I would say because Mariah's at the time just her age and that we thought about oh we should do this and that and it was more it was more about not a full in vitro process but I believe you know because twins actually run in my family everything but I think we actually were doing things that and taking some medicine to make sure we could stay pregnant because all right we had had miscarried a few times before really yeah so yeah you know and it was you know like I said there's those type of things where it's personal information right but it's you know and how we we actually it was probably early on in our marriage where we had gotten pregnant and was planning to tell everyone it was a beautiful situation I and I remember this story is stories crazy I never about told a few people just but it was like there was this time where we were it was during the holiday season you know Ryan's big on holidays mean more eyes promoting one of her Christmas albums at the time and she went on Ellen and there were all these rumors that rusty remarried that Mariah was was pregnant and at the time she actually was you know I mean and but we didn't want to tell anyone because was too early and that Ellie had since that she was so she wanted to do this big old pranking about Mariah's gonna announce it on their show and so she was gonna offer Mariah champagne and so and she's like hey Mariah drink this and she's like now I'm not drinking and then she was like why the only reason why you would not drink this is if you're pregnant you're Mariah Carey you always have champagne it's the holidays look take a sip she's like I'm not drinking Ellen and it was one of those things to where it was funny in the in the context but literally two days later we we miscarry or she you know and it's like how you know what I mean like that could even be in a great moment of Ellen was the first one to reveal it but then now it's kind of like it's a slap in the face to where you're like damn there was a reason why we weren't telling people and then that process when when two people were trying to have children like that's a very personal and intimate experience and that takes a lot out of the woman it puts a lot on your relationship and so for you know I think what that was Oh 8 for the next two and a half years that's all we were focused on and I some time thinking is me as I should do I need to take some [ __ ] forgiveness my little swimmers stronger and so yeah we can you go to you know doctors and they tell you about DJ tell you about all the things that you can do but then ultimately like we were like yeah we want to do this I was like we'll take any assistance right but we don't want to like go all the way and you know yeah but less - - so they say like something all of those you know medications can enhance this and do that and it is always find it really bizarre that all these celebrity women have twins and but I mean JLo Beyonce Twitter a robbery right like twins are incredibly rare readily random or those people just happen to have them oh what a coincidence fashionable right now I'm not buying it it's like I said it is what it is but be safe out there there are options every shitty game Truvada are you looking as doctors if I could take Truvada yeah absolutely and it's one of those things where you know if you're gonna be out there like that you know it's like you go wear a bulletproof vest before you you walk into that war field yeah are you just gonna hope that you could duck real quick you know you got to also understand like you know uh I personally believe HIV is chemical warfare and in its truest form anyway yeah they'd like to get rid of certain groups of people yeah and it worked yeah but at the end of the day and now garlis a super rare I mean regardless of how it developed it's still out it's still out there there's no cure and you know what you mean and you sure about that no magic Johnson you've got a special cure it's not just only what that is publicly it's not a death sentence because the actual medication that you could take once you get it you could live just as long as you would without it as long as you stay on your medication there's a cure for every man-made disease it's man a man made it it was made in the laboratory if they made it they got something that can get rid of it now how much they gonna charge you for that oh yeah ,2

incarcerated they were released after several months they say that their confessions were made under duress and above all the evidence proved their innocence it was then thought to be water poisoning mercury fertilizers or a nearby gas factory but the evidence disapproved these theories one by one since then important his play more far-fetched theories have surfaced [Music] Shatila koala we booked

sawaki don't say political or not this is Philippa the super clear but nothing is clear and for decades the incident goes unexplained but against all expectations 60 years later a new theory is proposed not from France but from the United States [Music] an American researcher in the Secret Service's Hank Alber le is investigating the suspicious death of a biochemist from the CIA frank olson a specialist in chemical weapons he carried out experiments on hard drugs like LSD he was also in France a few months before the poll sent his pre-incident afterwards he kept sinking into depression telling his wife that he'd made a terrible mistake Hank Alber le then made the link with the poll sent his pre-incident could it have been the CIA and the American army spraying LSD onto the bread I have no doubt at all that that policy esprit was a US Army covert experiment [Music] initially I had doubts and and I think initially my doubts were were motivated by by wishful thinking on my part where where I didn't want it to be an experiment I did you know I just it was hard to fathom the government doing that although at the same time there were a number of research tracks that were being conducted for the book at the same time so my my my being naive about what the government the US Army was capable of doing was the threshold for that was becoming was dwindling is it possible that the American has drugged an entire village in an ally country causing no doubt accidentally the death of seven people improbable however [Music] to understand what happened in pol cent history we need to look back at the end of the Second World War when the level of atrocities committed by the Nazis was discovered in the camps notably horrific experiments carried out on thousands of prisoners by chemists or doctors men lacerated poisoned burnt alive exposed to radiation the Allies hunted the war criminals from Hitler's regime in 1946 in Nuremberg the doctors are put on trial 22 men and one woman who experimented on human beings were they transformed into lab rats stand accused the trial sets a precedent seven of the accused are sentenced to death eleven given prison sentences and five are acquitted as a result the Americans draft the Nuremberg code a model which gives strict rules for experimenting on humans notably the voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential [Music] the experiment must be designed to avoid all unnecessary suffering physical and mental harm with the Nuremberg trial barely over the winners remain cynical the American Secret Service begins Operation Paperclip nearly 1500 German scientists including war criminals are expatriated to America they are offered a new life in exchange for their knowledge and cooperation it was a very serious game of propaganda that we were playing it was almost a Isle we're putting the Nazis on trial but in fact behind the curtain we're doing some very nasty things ourselves to basically incarcerated people poor people individuals who at the time were called feeble-minded had locked up in institutions and and if you were and in one of those institutions whether you were indigent or an unwed mother or had some sort of mental incapacity there's a good chance that you may have been incorporated in some sort of medical study possibly for the government or not where you would have been used and abused assisted by the German scientists the Americans begin pursuing their goal of the ultimate weapon and everything is allowed in the name of the cold war on the one side was the army whose priority is to win the nuclear arms race at the time to test the effects of radiation on a large scale they used their own soldiers between 1946 and 1962 between 250,000 and 500,000 men were exposed to radiation on Bikini Atoll or in the Nevada desert they were exposed with no protection unaware of the risks involved and afterwards the radiated particles were cleaned up with brooms these images served as propaganda for an army wanting to show off its technological power how about radiation you think is much danger from radiation all radiation is the least of the worries that the little thinking about I think most people who thought that radiation was the greatest danger didn't they what did they learn different prior to our intentions here we received a very thorough briefing before we even came in disclosed to contact with on the other side was the CIA who was above all interested in psychological manipulation their goal was to create an infallible truth serum wipe memories turn humans into robots and programmed them to kill conveniently in 1948 a researcher in the Sandoz laboratories albert hofmann discovers a molecule that ignites the secret service lysergic acid diethylamide or LSD it's derived from the same rod fungus long held responsible for the incident at Paul Santa's plane it was believed that the hallucinogenic properties of this drug were key to psychological manipulation fearing that the Russians would get their hands on sandoz's samples the Americans bought all of their stock the discovery of LSD was a godsend for the arm who on the brink of nuclear weapons were looking for a weapon that could defeat an enemy without firing any weapons the man who has headed this program longest was James Ketchum shown here in uniform he was a psychiatrist who was working for the military as a patriot he was prepared to push the boundaries in his research he tested around 30 drugs but especially LSD and the dangerous benzo late [Music] he treated 7,000 soldiers hundreds of whom later sued the army because of the side effects that they still experience and attribute to these drugs however when questioned James Ketchum sees things differently I think they're very patriotic have not been given credit they've been called innocent guinea pigs which they certainly were not they knew what they were doing and we told on us much as we could about it we had to limit the names of the drugs because some of them were artificially made and if we were to give out the name of course that would also reveal the structure and that we were afraid the Russian hood would get that they're apparently following our work we thought they were ahead of us but actually they weren't and so they were watching what we did to see what they could learn and use and they developed a similar drug leader themselves [Music] James Ketchum doesn't like this type of video as he believes they lead to confusion he claims the products were more festive than dangerous and prefers images like this of a soldier on LSD he also highlights this video volunteers who received minimal doses of LSD a few minutes later they were incapable of responding to simple orders or even doing basic exercises in parallel with the army the CIA was also developing its own programs codenamed Bluebird artichoke and later MKULTRA but to carry out these programs on a large scale they needed funds in 1950 the Korean War gave them the ideal pretext [Music] some American soldiers were captured [Music] during their detention pilots admitted having dropped chemical weapons on to Korea which was forbidden the Americans claimed this was due to psychological manipulation and the CIA took advantage of this godsend to obtain budgets that allowed them to work on brainwashing during the Korean War the American pilots who were captured started making apparently false confessions of germ warfare [Music] the first question is was it really false confessions but then when they were brought back to the United States the military and the military psychiatrists studied them and decided that there's mind-control operations being run against Americans so for defensive purposes we had to study this figured out therefore we created MKULTRA and before MKULTRA was Bluebird and artichoke so the whole rationale is its defensive it's because of what the Communists are doing problem is the Korean War started in June 1950 Bluebird was signed into operation by the head of the CIA in April 1950 the race is on and there are no limits devastating drugs are given to animals but it's mainly human subjects who interest the scientists in the edgewood camp where James Ketchum worked soldiers are called upon more and more they think they're testing gas masks in reality the canisters are filled with a toxic chemical and we're testing a whole assortment of different hallucinogens like LSD and marijuana and things like that and they explored other drugs very high levels of atropine scopolamine Wenzel aids very powerful and a lot of these soldiers ended up incapacitated it took them a long time to recover and while they're in recovery the doctors cannot do any more experiments because it's basically a very small base and testing operation in other words they needed a new site it's in this context of the Cold War and secret agents that on the 16th of August 1951 the tragedy at Pole sent us flee unfolded France was suffering economically and the Americans distrusted this ally they couldn't control the village was under the control of socialists at the time in the eyes of America they were Reds the epitome of the Soviet danger but the mayor bojay Castillo doesn't believe in a foreign conspiracy [Music] secrecy dimeric municipal police whistle aw to tell what the experiment Angela saying yeah you can configure kozyrev people we know a song called donkey suckers and that's what honey don't kill papa bien phu quoc I see a survey that a yellow city been warmed up yet American experts like Colin Ross are much more down-to-earth obviously that compound didn't just come in the rain or just wasn't sitting around naturally it was obviously organized controlled distributed so whether it was actually LSD or some other compound it doesn't make that much difference pont-saint-esprit is actually not just this happened once in the world and a village in France it's consistent with all the other experiments on the public that have done in the United States and done for a documented fact to achieve their goals with the Americans be prepared to use a whole village as a laboratory after all these are civilians not trained soldiers [Music] however in September 1950 nearly one year before point sent us plea this is exactly what they did and in their own country off the coast of San Francisco the American marines were carrying on military maneuvers a ship approached the coast am bombarded the city with the bacteria causing nakusoo mia sera Tia Marcos anse the military were testing the effects of spraying this through the air this classified secret defense map shows the scale of the targeted area at least 11 people were hospitalized one of whom died of pneumonia [Music] these are proven facts the official documents on this have been Declassified [Music] but at Paul said his plea the population remains skeptical after so many different theories a plot by the Americans just seems fanciful Haleh I don't lie I was a cop deaf son and I as I said no no Morrow is sleep apnea khadiyah kudo upon sent this way Metron prison you see he said no possibility of insanity onlys American law see Tom say Mohammed Rafi see Gina bragging Co inadmissible pass cojones Africa Kosovo be no war Safari the villagers wonder why is supposedly festive drug that is loved by hippies would have had such terrifying effects at poles had to scream James Ketchum the military psychiatrist who specialized in LSD a little reluctantly admits that the drug is scary for those who take it unknowingly some individuals could have a bad trip if someone gave them a list II and didn't tell them about it that's very anxiety-producing or if they were inexperienced and not particularly well balanced themselves took a fairly large dose of LSD they could have a bad trip how would you feel if you had a cup of coffee and started to see things going like this or like this brilliant colors appear in the ceiling or suddenly he felt her out of your body and looking down on herself these are all things that can happen with LSD but can these effects have a delayed onset impulse entity the older generation will remember the night of the apocalypse where dozens of men went mad and were sectioned in a psychiatric unit because of terrifying visions this night took place more than two weeks after the curse of bread was consumed but again James Ketchum admits that it's possible some individuals had flashbacks later in which they would go into a situation that where they had been when they were taking LSD and have a flood of the same emotions and some anxiety producing in 1951 French investigators also consider LSD and call upon Albert Hofmann inventor of the drug on the spot he tells the investigators that he has no doubt that the hallucinations were due to LSD but after returning to Switzerland he backtracks claiming he was mistaken the French want explanations but Public Health documents from 1951 show that the expert became suddenly unreachable we are sorry that the eminent professor has not been able to get back in touch with us I would think if the Santos scientists are saying it doesn't seem to be LSD they're just trying to cover up the fact that it's 100% for sure that LSD must have come from Santos because they were the only suppliers that's nothing more than a cover-up after months of inquiry the French investigators were so disoriented by the number of fruitless leads that the incident at Pole sent Esprit falls victim to its own mystery during this time the experiments continued in the United States and they reached a level never seen before in any country including the Soviet bloc [Music] entire populations for the concepts of large-scale tests here are some examples again uncontested cases that are recognized by the American government in 1953 radioactive iodine was injected into newborns and pregnant women and Iowa University and also in Nebraska in 1955 the CIA sprayed whooping cough bacteria off the coast of Tampa two died and dozens fell ill also in 1955 the CIA enlisted prostitutes in San Francisco opened two brothels and tested drugs on the clients the sex was then filmed through a one-way mirror in 1956 the army released millions of mosquitoes carrying yellow fever and dengue on the towns of Savannah and Avon there were several deaths and hundreds of people infected [Music] in 1960 in Cincinnati the army financed a radiation program on 90 destitute or ill inhabitants of the city's university hospital some died after several weeks in 1966 the army tested a virus in the New York metro then in Chicago the bacteria was concealed in electric bulbs the aim was to study the spread of chemical agents on a large scale for these experiments the army or the CIA funded laboratories in the most prestigious universities Yale Stanford Harvard or Columbia they all took part glorified by the idea of working for the nation's defense the researchers went crazy dr. Kligman in Philadelphia increases a dosage 468 times which actually frightened Dow Chemical they couldn't believe that a respected doctor would do that in Washington DC you had walter freeman who was a very very well known phlebotomist who traveled around the country doing lobotomies in his car and he would use an ice pick he could do 15 to 20 in a day [Music] it was just incredible what some doctors did and very few if any people in the hospital or the medical community blew the whistle on it it really wasn't an egregious act and it showed that the medical community was more interested in protecting its ass than in protecting the test subject and the patients because a lot of doctors went off the deep end and started doing things that are just inconceivable to help to express his indignation alan horne blue wrote half a dozen books a former prison guard at Holmesburg in pennsylvania from his first day at work over 40 years ago he had a horrible shock I was stunned to see scores of inmates with their shirts off strapped and wrapped in bandages and gauze tape and I couldn't imagine that I was going into an atmosphere that was that violent because all of the men looked like they had just walked of cellblock my fight they explained that it's not because of any violence but experiments that are carried out there Allen was the first to denounce this scandal and would lose his job as a result it was probably the largest human experimentation factory in America possibly the world from 51 until 1974 more people were probably incorporated in more experiments than any other place in the world [Applause] [Music] drugs viruses cancerous cells lutonium sarin gas the most toxic products were tested in homes burned but also in dozens of prisons throughout the country to condemn these experiments alan horne bloom found former inmates like Youssef in 1961 this man was imprisoned for selling marijuana he was poor with limited education he was offered a chance to take part in tests for $1 a day since then Youssef has had his digestive tract operated on he has liver and skin problems and can no longer work his first test was for a bath foam from the company Johnson & Johnson they took tape and they stuck it on your back and pulled it off stuck it on and pull it off until the first layer of skin came off your back [Music] and he puts six seconds six seconds on my back like that and then they took a bottle with the Johnson and Johnson bubble bath and put it on a patch and put the patch over the wrong area then they took a can I recognize that Candice being from the Army and I was like what Johnson but Johnson Johnson's got to do with this so he took the can and he sprayed it on my back and when it hit my back it was cold but it was so toxic and like fumes I could taste it in my mouth and as I'm walking down I'm getting dizzy and dizzier dizzier and dizzier by the time I step into my cell I passed out oh well my back was inflamed and by the time I woke up that morning I had great big blisters on my back full of pus this rash just gets worse and worse and it looks like when the moon come out at night it's just it flames up and I'm being moaning and crying and moaning and crying myself artists couldn't sleep there was a second test which would lead to an operation on his intestines then a third where he had to do simple sums while drinking a colorless liquid we goes over there a little shot cup and it could look like water we drink sit everything became magnified and sent like that loud speaker and his sister the walls look like they turned in the water you know to me and I I spent the whole time like looking around I said instead of doing the doing the test so I goes back to the block in that condition and man I mean I was tripping and it was like a slow-acting drug that was in that cup it last for weeks the inmates start naming me out of the limits I had no conversation for nobody I was scared of the inmates and the inmates act like they was afraid of me what you had were hundreds and hundreds of uneducated minorities overwhelmingly black and Puerto Rican and then you had white doctors with white lab coats with PhD or MD after their name and it it was a recipe for abuse if not disaster and those prison walls are an ideal spot to do controversial experiments because just as those walls keep the inmates in they also keep the public out so no one finds out about it prisoners were used but also patients in certain hospitals patients were steered towards the services financed by the CIA these services carried out limitless experiments on psychological manipulation in 1965 karin Wetmore was only 13 when she was admitted to a hospital in Vermont she stayed there several times in her childhood she suffered from severe depression after falling victim to a pedophile neighbor admitted against her will she was not allowed any contact with her family being told that it was for her own good the CIA was specifically looking for children between the ages of 13 and 18 to further dissociate they wanted the associative children their sense of absolute and total helplessness you're there you're bound up you're locked in this room no matter how you scream no matter what you say no one is gonna call me it does something to you something you don't get over the doctors went to work on Karen they wanted to erase her memory and create a robot at their command it took 30 years of legal battles for Karen to obtain her medical records and discover the violence of the treatments she was subjected to this is seclusion full cam cam is a straitjacket and toys which means they tied my arms and they tied my feet this goes on uninterrupted day after day week after week February March April right up until June 21st 1971 you sleep on the floor on the floor no blanket no nothing and my arms were secured like this behind my back I read do remember that it's extremely painful because it pulls on your neck pulls on your show you can't get away from it it is it's maddening is what it is maddening and I was naked and I think that was part of the effort of that experiment to break me down everything they did was to break me down months in a confined room with no bearings while her captors administered all kinds of drugs and sometimes electric shocks at inhuman levels number of shocks and the seconds that they held the shocks they 30 30 35 35 35 and they held it for sustain for 40 seconds a normal shock would be a second not certainly not and certainly not 30 and 35 of them one not that many which probably is what obliterated my memory right there and I think that's why they did it that's why they did it they also said this treatment right here no seizure shock restarted so they gave me a second one because they couldn't produce a seizure so we must have done it over again muster Peter then it's unforgivable and I'm sure I wasn't the only one they did this to I'm sure I survived to be able to talk about it how many suffered similar experiments in Montreal Canada the CIA used a world renowned psychiatrist to set up a factory of guinea pigs in the Allen memorial psychiatric Department in McGill University this psychiatrist was Ewen Cameron one of the all-powerful presidents of the world psychiatric association in 1945 Ewen Cameron made the acquaintance of Rudolf Hess one of the Nazis accused in the Nuremberg trial in 1957 the CIA recruited him for their MKULTRA program the Americans want to perfect their interrogation techniques and program a human to kill UN Cameron became the mad dog of psychiatry he put his patients in vegetative States for several weeks and while bombarding them with pre-recorded orders some would become incontinent amnezia for hitting even who their parents were and how they speak the Vermont hospital were caring what more was confined was working on the same program in the hands of the CIA doctors she was like a rag doll there's drugs like LSD they used electric shock they used chemical shock agent mattress all which I was given in in 1971 and I found that out in my medical records which is a very brutal drug very brutal drug CIA said it was excruciating physically and emotionally excruciating drug they I have a quote from the CIA that said that the Soviet youth Soviets used it in the gulag and that APO W would say or do anything to avoid a second dose a nice drug [Music] they gave me 1,800 milligrams which apparently is a huge dose and that night I was complaining of hearing men inside my head which was bothering me and upsetting me and I tried to set myself on fire the imagination of the scientists is limitless in these images the bold charges at a Cape shaken in front of him a few moments later an implant is placed in his brain and he's released back into the ring at each charge he receives a shot that stops him in his tracks documents that are now Declassified show that more sophisticated implants were tested on human subjects there's all kinds of people who believe that people who don't believe and that's a debate about do you believe or don't believe I'm always interested in what are in the documents saying so the documents clearly describe implanting electrodes in people's brains activating the electrode from a remote transmitter and changing the person's behavior from angry pounding the wall sitting there to steering behind Karen's ear is a scar and she doesn't know what it's from what's my therapist really understood that I hadn't really been experimented on by the CIA she said to me you know just for the heck of it let me look because we'd heard about we'd read about there there's been information about these implants and I'm like okay and it was there actually there this is I showed you I went to a plastic surgeon who told me it was a surgical scar but there's nothing in my medical history nothing in a medical record that that shows any kind of problem ever oh behind my right ear or any incision or any surgery or anything else but there it is karen has been compensated by the American government for her ordeal but like many rare victims who speak up for a long time she was considered crazy [Music] what stopped the journey down this destructive path in 1973 while Watergate is rattling all the institutions Richard Helms director of the CIA feels the winds of change he works as a lone wolf and hasn't informed the president of these experiments he knows he's crossed the line to protect himself he orders the destruction of all documents relating to the MKULTRA program and its abandonment two years later in 1975 the President Gerald Ford orders an inquiry into the CIA the Rockefeller Commission is sworn in the task isn't simple because at the heart of the CIA even Richard Helms close lieutenants know nothing about the brainwashing programs it's not like goofy things go on in a big agency like that was all that secrecy things can go on that you don't know about that the people who are working for the director well so don't know about or that the director doesn't know about it I think they're keeping it quiet down there don't tell anybody if it works then we'll tell them but in the meantime don't get into any any difficulties I remember when they wanted to take a kitty cat and stick a microphone up its rear end and and put an antenna on its ear and have him walk in with a spy in the you know park with another one walk over it walk around and listen in on it yeah they tried it one time in an experiment the taxi came by and ran over the cat you know in reality nothing is funny and it's haste to get rid of evidence the CIA forgets 20 thousand documents a drop of water compared to the amount that was destroyed but they reveal that it financed 149 programs implicating 80 institutions including the most respected called on to justify themselves the heads of the CIA like dr. lashbrooke lie and downplay the facts the curse claims or thoughts of many great things could be done with hypnosis one small project in which we had a hypnotist I do some experiments primarily to see what the limitations of hypnosis might be can you make a person do something under hypnosis that he would not ordinarily do even if the head of the CIA Richard Helms tried to minimize the scale of the experiments the victims testimonies contradict him the Inquiry Commission's follow each reaching more and more witnesses like this woman Chris de Nicola the father put her in the hands of a reputed CIA doctor dr. green when she was 12 years old his objective was to gain control of my mind and trained me to be a spy assassin doctor brain had electrodes on my body including my head he used what looked like an overhead projector and repeatedly said he was burning different images into my brain while a red light flashed aimed at my forehead in between each sequence he used electric shock on my body and told me to go deeper and deeper deeper while repeating each image would go deeper into my brain and I would do whatever he told me to do dr. green moved on wanted me to kill dolls that look like real children then there was Claudia Mullen admitted at age 7 57 1982 I became a part in the government scheme his health and the goal was mind control and to create the perfect spy all through the use of chemicals radiation drugs hypnosis electric shock isolation in terms of water sleep deprivation brainwashing verbal physical emotional and sexual abuse I was exploited I'm we're doing for nearly three decades in my life and the only explanations given to me with that quote the end justifies the means and quote I was serving my country in their bold effort to fight communism enquiry reports that resulted from these terrifying testimonies revealed one thing for certain the experiments ended in disaster in its insane quest for a robot human or a truth serum the CIA failed on August 3rd 1995 with the revelations mounting up then President Bill Clinton makes a public apology [Music] thousands of government-sponsored experiments did take place at hospitals universities and military bases around our nation in too many cases informed consent was withheld Americans were kept in the dark about the effects of what was being done to them the deception extended beyond the test subjects themselves to encompass their families and the American people as a whole for these experiments were kept secret and they were shrouded not for a compelling reason of national security but for the simple fear of embarrassment and that was wrong so today on behalf of another generation of American leaders and another generation of American citizens the United States of America offers a sincere apology to those of our citizens who were subjected to these experiments to their families and to their communities since then a great number of secret archives have been released to the public domain researchers would take an interest in this troubled period notably Hank Alber Ellie who worked on the suspicious death of Frank Olson the biochemist who worked at the heart of the CIA since 1951 the year of the pole sent his pre-incident Frank Olson called into question the ethics of the experiments being carried out and became depressed as a result in November 1953 the CIA put LSD into his glass without him knowing nine days later he threw himself off the 13th floor of a New York hotel murder or suicide we'll never know at the time of the investigation Henning Cal barely found a surprising document coming from the White House it's surprisingly linked the name of Frank Olson to Paul sent his plea why in the middle of the Korean War where the White House be interested in this small French village even better pink also came across a study carried out by the CIA on LSD the document itself was a comprehensive overview or history if you will of LSD specifically yes not on your gut had nothing to do with ergo there was a section or a chapter if you will had an incident at Po st. Esprit and the first two paragraphs of that describe essentially what we've all read you know many times over in terms of what happened that at pulsator spree but the remainder of that section the the rest of that page which was about half the page in the two pages of fog were completely blacked out above all was this damning document from the CIA it dates from 1953 and has no doubt and declassified by mistake a director at Sandoz laboratories confirmed to a secret agent that the poll sent Esprit incident was caused by LSD [Music] Sandoz laboratories was where albert hofmann worked the man who discovered LSD it even claimed the drug was responsible for the polenta spree tragedy before recanting when I saw the document detailing the meeting between the CIA Informer and the sandals official corporate official who was not Hoffman I still haven't been able to identify that person it became moral and clear that sandals of course was was part and parcel of the experiment probably you know provided the drug to the to the camp Dietrich personnel that were on site and and well knew about what had actually occurred at at Paul st.

0W2J6MtVR8M,"In October 2016, Wikileaks released over 33,000
pages of emails from John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign chair. The Clinton campaign has refused to authenticate
individual emails provided by wikileaks, instead, saying correctly that the Russian government
appears to be behind the attack. There are no bombshells in these emails. If you were planning on voting for Hillary
Clinton, you’re probably still going to do so, and if you weren’t planning on voting
for Clinton, you probably won’t. That said, I think these emails will be really
concerning to a lot of liberals who fear and have already feared that Clinton is too close
to bankers on Wall Street. Sanders: Our job is to take on Wall Street,
not to take their money Bash: Secretary Clinton, the question was
about the transcripts of the speeches to Goldman Sachs. Why not release them? One of the ironies of this story is that we
know about these emails at all because the campaign itself did self-opposition research
to find what in her Goldman Sachs speeches could prove damaging should they leak. Among the stuff that’s gotten the most attention
is Clinton saying that Dodd-Frank, Obama’s signature initiative to reign in Wall Street,
was, quote, “passed for political reasons.” that doesn’t mean necessarily that her bank
regulation platform is any weaker than Donald Trump’s. It’s not, it’s much tougher. But for the left wing of the party, that sees
Clinton as already too close to a lot of these interests, this is just going to confirm those
suspicions. You can see aides in the emails, internally debating how
to make sure that her apparent tone deafness on Wall Street didn’t seep out into the
public. One example that really drives this home is
that right after the campaign launched, Bill Clinton was planning on giving a speech at
Morgan Stanley, and Clinton’s aides freaked out about this. They said this is something we shouldn’t
do and Hillary herself appeared to be okay with it. Now, again, if you are a Clinton fan, you
probably don’t think that’s a big deal, you probably think that Clinton and her husband
can march into Wall Street, say what they need to say, collect the money, and not change
their viewpoints at all. I have never, ever been influenced in a view or a vote by anyone who has given me any kind of funding. But it does speak to, I think, something that
we’ve long suspected, which is that Hillary herself doesn’t really see the political ramifications
for appearing close to Wall Street, or doesn’t care. Another piece of context that people really
should keep in mind is that if you’re going to hold Clinton herself to blame for a lot
of this stuff, you also have to find fault with Obama. Similarly, Republicans crying foul over this
is pretty rich. The Republican party has curried extensive
ties with big money donors, and for years maintained that it wasn’t influencing their
politicians. The emails also show that Clinton agreed
to go to Morocco in exchange for a $12 million donation to the Clinton Global Initiative. Now, Clinton herself wasn’t Secretary of
State at this time. There’s no reason to believe that there
was a quid pro quo in which she promised to do a government favor in exchange for something
that the Moroccan government wanted. But it does, again, add to this idea that
Clinton was more likely to meet with people who gave lots of money to her husband’s
private charity. We should be very clear, the Clinton Foundation
has done genuinely live-saving work all over the world. That said, it certainly won’t erase fears
from the left wing of the Democratic party that the reason people were giving to the
foundation was to curry favor with a potential Clinton white house. One of the interesting debates from the emails
has to do with the Cadillac Tax, which taxes luxury healthcare plans at a higher rate than
other plans. You can see from the internal debates in the
emails that the Cadillac Tax sharply divided Clinton’s team. On the one hand you had her political aides,
which were strongly urging her to back away from the Cadillac Tax in order to win the
endorsement of unions, who she needed in the Democratic primary. On the other hand, her policy aides clearly
thought that this was the right agenda, and urged her to support it. This is how all politicians operate. They take a policy position that they think
is good, and they weigh it against the political considerations. That said, getting a chance to see how that
works yourself can sometimes be an ugly sight. ",1
oDRzdTHRPIE,"I'd like to keep this channel strictly around property investment however so many people are asking me my opinion on corona the truth is I'm not really sure exactly what I think about it in terms of what a lot of the other guys are saying you can't ignore the fact that so many very rich people Robert Kiyosaki Grant Cardone even Elon Musk and people talking about the corona as if it's a little bit of a scam about the government adding it with an agenda there is no Kovach 19 it doesn't exist and now I've got governments regulators trillion-dollar Silicon Valley companies and basically every social media platform Under the Sun that have banned me they're coming after me they're coming after my company and coming after my reputation stop the [ __ ] media people you're blowing this up because you know full well one thing that the worst you make it look the more people will watch the news and right now and lock down to it we can't leave the house well you know number one you can go out it's it's interesting to me how many people are just so easily giving up on their freedom and just going into agreement with the regulations look how many people just said okay must stay in know almost no one's challenging it yeah I'm not staying in I mean I'm in my studio right now I think they said I'm not supposed to be here the police had been here like three times this week and I got a security guy that said yeah tell them mr. cardones inside I'll tell them he's not supposed to be here like like like I'm not going to give up on my freedom okay like I'm not going to give up on my ability to produce and to create I've gotten more covet emails man during this time and it all starts off the same way during Coe bid 19 I hope your family's well dude I didn't I'm not reading your email because I need you to wish good stuff for my family what can you do for me how can you help me how can we make money together yeah but then you say it's gonna be a little harder you have to speak to little people but then you also say we need to think bigger so well yeah because if it's gonna be harder yeah bro there better be some gold down there and to get if the ground is harder to pick in there better something underneath that ground if the works harder the payoff ought to be bigger yeah and when the payoffs not big enough what happens is people quit sure see I'm confident this whole thing has got nothing to do with a virus I'm confident this is completely about wealth redistribution where we're going through the one of the biggest wealth redistributions in the history of mankind so what's not going to look like so what that means is that means people in the middle class are basically having money wealth taken from them yeah and it's getting redistributed yeah everybody in America gets a $1,200 check alright it looks like everybody in America is gonna get a $1,200 check but what happens is what happens once you get to 1200 most of those people are gonna go spend it on some stupid stuff mmm and this is what the wealthy know yeah give them all the money they want they're not gonna keep it there's no plan to keep it there's no plan for well there's no plan to invest you can't get money from me because I take my money I get rid of money and I buy a real property with it whack the people that were half committed if you were not 100 percent committed to your tasks like Elon Musk is Elon Musk ain't he he's not stopping anything yeah so this is almost going to draw a line into the sum between the people that are the real action takers the real hard work was the real commit people and those that are not really serious the people that have partial commitments just gave up the people that have 75 percent commitment most of them have given up I mean you have to have be obsessed or be average yeah you have to be completely insane in a good way but then they run you got to be this guy right here yeah ain't no buyers gonna stop him this is a net this is a manufactured Great Depression when there was real unemployment now they have to manufacture unemployment I mean it's more frightening than I ever imagined it's more dastardly as more deceptive it's more criminal than I ever imagined I'm not that I'm afraid but I feel for the people who were to the people who really think it's about the virus not the biggest cash highs going on behind their backs in the repo market the commercial paper market and the credit markets they just can't see their money is being stolen via their money I would love to know what you think about all this craziness listen I know how to make a lot of money in property I don't want to speak too much about the coronavirus I don't want my YouTube channel to get taken down like many other people's videos are getting taken down but what I do know is that they're printing a lot of money right now what I do know is that the rich are gonna get richer and the poor are gonna get poorer

YgP_Au5RZVw,"(somber music) - This may be one of the more important podcasts we've done. We all know we're living in
extraordinarily intense times, the most intense most
of us have experienced, at least in our adult lives. The challenge that
we're experiencing today are as intense as we've ever seen, and the challenge is not
only people are dying, but people are dying alone. Families can't visit
with their family members because of understanding of the virus and our concerns about
how it could spread. And we're living in a world where, quite frankly, we've made decisions that are also affecting not just the people that
have already passed away but also are gonna affect
people in the future, and also the ways we've
responded to this virus are having gigantic
effects around the world. There are people all over the world that are having all kinds of challenges. 90% of brain surgeries haven't happened. I could go through a whole list, but the feeding problem is one of the things I'm
most concerned about, and people moving into poverty, which leads to deaths as well. The World Food Organization
that the UN sponsors is saying maybe 265 million people
might go hungry this year, almost double what normally happens. I wanted today to see if we could go on kind of an exploration, if you will, a journey, not a trip. A trip's predictable. A journey you might be surprised. And I've been on a journey because I care so much
and I know you do too. What does this mean? I have my own parents that are my mother and father in law, but they're in their 70s. I adore them and
obviously extreme concern, so I started to immerse myself in every detail I could
find on the science of this. And as I did, I came across a set of
doctors, Nobel Prize winners, professors of epidemiology, some of the most qualified
people in the world that we're bringing up new
facts that we have today that are very different
than we made the decisions to shut down the world economy. Science is about as new facts come forward
make new decisions, but sometimes the momentum of the story and the fear takes us over. - I think cases become a big
issue for clinical reasons. Unfortunately, there's a
huge amount of politics in all of this everywhere. I think that, unfortunately,
science is difficult and you can't make promises, and I think that there was a dynamic here and a dynamic which I
found very anti-scientific that lead to decisions being made. The World Health Organization
has a record of exaggerating and I think they do this deliberately because they fear that the
public won't pay attention. The total number of excess deaths reported by a website called EuroMOMO up till today is 160,000, maybe 170,000. Basically that's about
the same number of people who died in an excess way in the flu season of 2017, '18. So basically my guess is it's going to be maybe one and a half
times more excess deaths. Excess deaths are very important because if I'm very sick and then I'm laid with a corona death that's fine, except I
won't die again next month. So basically if you
look at the total deaths each person is only counted once, whereas if you assume that
everyone who dies of corona is extra, you're overcounting. - One of the challenges is
that when people were looking at all the numbers that
were coming out of the TV and they were doing the death rate, the case fatality rates, they were looking really, and this is, I'll call it a rookie 101 mistake in epidemiology, in that you don't take the incident rate to figure out the case fatality, you look at the prevalence. And it was stunning to
me that all the media would put on these so called experts and not raise this issue as to why the case fatality rate is just completely and
absolutely overstated. Yes, we as citizens need to be responsible and we need to think about what we do and how it impacts those around us, but we shouldn't be so fearful that we decide to live in a bubble and hermetically seal our home in hopes that we never get
anymore diseases ever again. That's just nonsense. - I would submit that we're
pivoting towards a time now where we have to ask ourselves questions about who are we, what is our country, are we losing personal liberties, if we're going to use contact tracing, what does that look like? Does that look like
voluntary use of our form or is it gonna be involuntary? Are there gonna be drones
that swoop and watch us? We need to be very careful because in the end, when
we're all said and done, we're looking at a respiratory virus, a single-stranded RNA virus. We've dealt with these before. And we know that 40 to
50% of people who get it may not even know they had it. We know another 40, 50% that get it will skate through it. We know that we're probably gonna, at the end of the day, end up somewhere between one out of 1,000
patients dying from it. - It's interesting because when I was doing the research originally, I remember in late February I was watching everyday
because I'm concerned that the death rate
shot up 600% in one day, and I'm no epidemiologist, but
that didn't make any sense, I'm talking about the world death rate. And then I dug in and
finally found the labs that said they could change
the diagnostic procedure to no longer having to do a test since as late as February, and that's why the number of
deaths shot through the roof because anything they suspected as COVID, they listed as COVID. And then a few weeks
ago, as I know you know, the CDC made it formal in the US that you don't need to do a test, just if you suspect it. But there's actually even,
as I understand from you, economic incentives by the hospitals 'cause some have been reclassified as COVID-19 deaths after the fact, and what is that financial
incentive they'll share with us? - We were basically being
advised as physicians as to how to correctly
complete a death certificate if COVID-19 was involved directly or perhaps even presumptively or probably or peripherally involved. I was coached and massaged
to utilize COVID-19 as a factor in the causation of death even if I hadn't checked a COVID-19 test, even if I hadn't had an interest in one. And right around that time, Dr. Burks from Washington, D.C. was saying that nobody's going to die with COVID-19, if they have it, they're dying of it. And that was about a silly
a thing as I have heard because if a person gets hit by a bus and over the first two hours of examination in an emergency room we learn that both of
their lungs are collapsed but also some baseline laboratory works addressed the fact that
there was a low hemoglobin but also a COVID-19 test
happened to be positive in the PCR form of it, it would be absolutely
ridiculous to put down COVID-19. On the one hand, part of my life is in the trenches
practice and primary care and then I come down to the capital where I see this partisan
battle for power. And the best way to power sometimes is to keep people frightened and then tell 'em who to blame, and after you've done enough of that then sort of step up and
raise your hand and say but follow me, I'll take care of you. That's sort of a typical formula
in the world of politics. And I think sometimes
when these things happen, we don't recognize them at the time, it's when we look at them
through the retrospectiscope, so I really think the crisis is pivoting. - If you look at the case fatality rate, the number of people who die who get it, it's over 3% when you get to 70 and over. That's a real risk. - [Tony] Yes. - Look at 60 and under,
it's less than 2/10 of 1%, or about less than twice the flu, but really what you need to do is protect people who
are over the age of 70. Protect them from the risk they would have if they were exposed to the virus 'cause they're in that 3 to 5% death rate from getting the disease. On the other hand, most of the economy is driven by younger people, 95 to 97%, and they don't need to be protected. We made that mistake early on in looking at the data from China and we will probably
come back and regret it, but you could really
open up the whole economy and not have much increase in the risk. The problem is without the economy open, we're having more deaths of despair than we are deaths from the COVID virus. - Now what we're seeing is
the collateral damage of COVID is way outweighing the disease itself. I can tell you about
suicide cases personally, 23-year-old. I can tell you about anxiety,
depression, alcoholism, all in my community that
are sky-rocketing now because of COVID. So I think the conversation
has to switch now to how do we get the economy going again because the collateral damage
of the economy shutdown is becoming far worse
than the virus itself. - We took a Hippocratic Oath to do no harm and to tell the truth and we looked at our numbers and we had some of Stanford's
preliminary data was out. We were looking at these different studies and we're saying the epidemiology of this
disease is similar to flu. And have we ever shut down for flu before? We haven't. Does it make sense to
shut down the economy, to have folks not have work, not be able to support their families? Influenza is a very dangerous disease. I've had folks in their 30s
and 40s die from influenza when I used to work in the ER, so as Dr. Erickson said
influenza is very serious, but we are familiar with influenza, so we say it's just a flu. So whenever you have something that you're unfamiliar
with, you have lots of fear, and then trying to change
people's narrative, their mindset, with new data is very, very difficult because they have that old mindset. - I'm an infectious disease physician, and my sort of understanding, and not also disease modeling, my understanding is a disease like this spreads quite widely and so the numbers didn't quite add up. So that's why we put that study together. And we sampled a group
of well over 3000 people. We used a test kit that by now has been vetted very carefully and we know exactly what it tells us. One thing that I was hoping
that our study would do is reduce that uncertainty. We were living with such an
enormous amount of uncertainty and I think that uncertainty was really getting people worked up. And like many here, I wish this were not a political issue, I wish this were an area
where we could come together and say okay we need to
count all false deaths because the coding is not
something that is reliable. We need to understand
the issue about immunity. We need to understand the issue about the age distribution and the differences across ages. And these are some of
the very key priorities that will help us really
learn how to deal with it. We have to start wrapping our head around making decisions in a more informed way. - The whole purpose of
this is to honor those that have already put their
lives on the line for us, so many doctors and nurses. I cry just thinking about it. So many police officers, first responders, people driving trucks so that we can still have our livelihood and our life and be with our families
that get taken for granted. I know most of you don't
take them for granted, but I hope in the midst of this we don't lose track of all
that they've done for us. Please remember we human beings
are pretty damn resilient. We've been around 200,000 years. We've experienced every kind
of change in the environment, every kind of microbe, every kind of challenge you could imagine, and here we still stand
for better or worse, hopefully for better. And just remember life
is meant to be lived. And sometimes we can get overcome by the drama by what we
see and hear every moment and by dealing with real
challenges that we forget that this life is still meant to be lived. So whether it be winter,
spring, summer, fall, whether it be in tough
times or good times, I hope you'll find
gratitude and joy and love with the people that you love and you'll continue to grow
and continue to expand. So no matter what happens economically, what happens in the environment, there's a quality of life waiting to be lived and enjoyed by you by just finding things to be grateful for in the midst of challenge. That's I think how we stay resilient, that's how we keep
moving the ball forward, that's how we serve our children, our family, and our friends. So live fully, live with passion, and hopefully until we
meet again, God bless. (soft tender music) ",1
aG1lNV-_z1k,[Music] all right class is in session once again and i am honored and privileged uh to be in the presence of someone i've been so anxious to speak with and learn from and dive in create some discourse uh doctor of clinical psychology and certified school psychologist activist lecturer leader teacher professor the list goes on uh author of psychoacademic holocaust the special education and adhd wars against black boys uh the one and only dr umar johnson my brother he's in black power good to see you man come on man had to get to it absolutely absolutely we talked about it for uh some time and i've you know been a fan of your wisdom and your knowledge and your movement uh and your outspokenness you know what i mean on so many different platforms i've seen you go toe to toe head to head with with the best and um and really just being unapologetic and as you know you could call it unapologetically african yes sir yes sir where did that come from where does that like ultimately like this this drive to to feed our people and to be so strong uh in in your in your rhetoric when i was in the uh third grade we lived in north carolina my father was in the marine corps okay and it was in north carolina that i decided i wanted to be a psychologist okay i was the oldest boy didn't have an older brother right so i said i wanted to be the older brother that other children could talk to wow if they had problems got it so when we moved back to philadelphia mead elementary school which is in the heart of north philly the ghetto we had a black history class which was mandatory by the way yeah so i thought black history was required because it was for us right right so our black history teacher was a sister by the name of mrs green and mrs green really planted in us a love for self and a love for knowledge of self so in many respects i am an example of what happens when you're taught who you are at an early age so fourth and fifth grade was black history that was elementary school but then right around the corner was the philadelphia division of marcus garvey's unia okay okay and so when i graduated from college i joined the garvey movement and it was at the garvey movement where the elders continued to plant that seed that was originally inculcated by mrs green around the corner but almost 20 years earlier i'm a true product of the political struggle of north philadelphia right and being a school psychologist was a unique caveat to the freedom struggle because there were no other black male school psychologists in the freedom struggle right so the elders at the garvey movement in philadelphia sunday mass meetings which they've been holding since garvey started the organization in jamaica 1914 sunday's at three o'clock over 100 years now wow so they would always ask me to stand up and talk about what school psychologists do right really because there was no other items on the agenda so i was filler yeah i was the only young member and i was filler so i would get up and talk about ritalin adderall adhd the learning disabilities autism a lot of people hadn't heard of school psychology yeah okay so it was my job to help educate them on that and then people would come to the meetings and they would just start asking me to come speak other places yeah you mind coming to my black history program my university my community college would you pop in on my kwanzaa celebration so literally it was word of mouth yeah that kind of got me started but it all began with the garvey movement the unapologetically african movement was something i began back in 20 i want to say 2012 2013 and i started that once again a spin-off from garveyism that teaches black pride love of self not a hate for no one else but an appreciation for who we are our uniqueness right and in being a psychologist being a school psychologist and studying african behavior particularly when we get around other cultural groups i saw that we began to shy away from who we were we began to imitate something that we were not we felt ashamed of our hair our skin the way we walk talk our food right and i'm like are you kidding almost 400 years since we've been here under white oppression right you've been here longer but under wide oppression under this government 400 years and we're still afraid to be who we are right so i came up with unapologetically african to say that we have a right to exist we have a right to our uniqueness and we have a right to push and proliferate our own unique african cultural contribution to human experience right so what do you think the moment was or the movement uh was where the notoriety came nationally and globally what was that what set it off that set off in 2010 i was invited to come to chicago to do a public access television interview on chicago's public access network and um a brother called me up he said listen somebody just sent me an article you wrote on the scooter prison pipeline it was powerful i need you to come up here i can't get you up here but if you can get up here we can make this happen right so i said chicago that's the second largest black city i got to handle this yeah so i went up there we did the interview and it's amazing it's interesting how destiny works because he only had one copy of the dvd of the interview yeah and i said i need a copy of that i just needed a copy i didn't know why but i said i needed a copy of that he said this is my only one but he said you know what i'ma give it to you because i can get another one next week yeah so he gave me that dvd had he not given me that dvd we may not even be here now because what happens is three weeks later i speak in new york city for the first time harlem right now i've spoken in new york before but it was strictly for the garvey movement never a public lecture of my own right so at the national black theater 125th and fifth i broke copies of the chicago interview um so you see these are the largest black cities right and so when it comes to my rise within black consciousness i really have to hang my hat on the support i got from new york city in chicago yeah yeah because it was the chicago interview and then the new york lecture once i did that lecture i'll never forget it october 30th 2010 it was the night before halloween it was a nice turnout uh but i didn't think nothing of it i'm just doing what i do yeah getting the information out and literally brother when i tell you within 48 hours i was a household name wow 48 hours i was a household name like my phone was just ringing non-stop non-stop 2011 came i think i did an interview at least once every day for 365 days wow it just it caught me by surprise yeah i was in philly working as a school psychologist doing my thing and then the invitation started coming and i said okay you got to make a decision because this is taking you away from your practice right right so i evaluate children for special ed i can't do that and travel right so i decided to sacrifice the testing and do the traveling and it was a good decision because i was able to help push the message not only the pan-african message but also the school-to-prison pipeline message to tell parents stop getting your children tested stop putting them on ritalin stop buying into these diagnosis because they're not solutions they are feeding the school-to-prison pipeline right and and i mean that's been one of your strong messages and i tapped into it uh pretty pretty early just based off of feeling like i i was almost a part of that pipeline somebody that you know second grade diagnosed with adhd you know uh was my family was challenged to put me on some type of medication but otherwise they they did they gave me some it was interesting they gave me another type of test that i actually scored uh the third highest in the nation and then so from that process of thinking like something might be wrong with this child it then implemented me into the gate program in california with the gifted and talented education and from there you know even my grandmother having that foresight uh that man maybe if we challenge him you know he's he he won't act out in that certain way so be getting to getting me involved in everything from you know other languages and music and and for there it's like it's a simple concept for me it's like you know a lot of us we don't have learning disabilities but we're so far advanced absolutely uh in our understanding in our movement that we're just not challenged absolutely in fact you just basically explain what's really going on with black boys and so-called adhd it's not an overactive brain it's above average intelligence you see the issue is that public school is not designed to identify black boys who are gifted the gifted movement was started in the aftermath of school desegregation 1954 to re-segregate black kids from white kids so after the supreme court said you can't use race to separate the students anymore white power said well we need a new excuse right so they invented the mentally gifted movement right so instead of saying we're putting a black child in the separate class or putting the white child in a separate class because they're black or white we're excluding the white kid from the black class because they're too intelligent so it's not about race wow it's about intelligence right so mg became the new strategy to re-segregate the students wow you see yeah so if we're using giftedness to explain away black kids away from the white kids we can't possibly use giftedness to help support black children right but the problem with mg nick is that not all the white kids are gifted either right right yeah so even though you were helping some of them get out a lot of them weren't smart enough to qualify right then they had another problem they said but what about the ones who don't make it right they still don't want them learning with the black kids right so that's when they invented the learning disability but in my work at least half the black boys i've ever evaluated were mentally gifted not adhd but the school has a one-track mind they are trained to look for problems not talents right one more point today mental giftedness used to be part of special ed law that means what special ed is money right whenever i say a kid is [ __ ] autistic emotionally disturbed reading disabled math disabled their name goes into a computer that goes to the state department of education they get a welfare check by the end of the month for that child that school does the school day special ed is money right special ed is money it ain't about helping nobody wow now gifted used to be in there that means what when you were tested for gifted and qualified right your school district got money for you wow right yeah but when former president george w bush reauthorized special ed law in o4 actually before he reauthorized it back in 97 i want to say they took mg out of special ed law that means what you no longer get money for identifying smart black children right since they've taken that out if you look at the gifted rates of blackheads is almost non-existent wow [ __ ] up here reading disabled up here adhd up head mg all the way down here and it's even worse now because they're not being subsidized to find the talented black voice wow so that brings up an interesting point that you discuss in your book about labeling um on both ends of the spectrum you know what i mean like a kid being gifted a kid uh having mental illness at some point yourself being a child psychologist you have to actually apply those labels to different individuals just that concept of you know compartmentalizing children um ultimately is is that helpful or ultimately it's very unethical to me it's a human rights abuse and i would even argue that the mental health exploitation of black children and the miseducation of black children not only constitutes a modern day holocaust i think it's one of the greatest examples of human rights abuse in the world today like we we hear about the genocides and we hear about hunger and we hear about political oppression what about the miseducation and mental health exploitation of black children it's right up there right but to your point three reasons i have an issue with child mental health even though i'm in child mental health issue number one children are not self-referred for therapy what does that mean if i'm eight years old right and somebody says i need an adhd evaluation because i'm too hyper or i cannot focus did i ask for that evaluation how many third grade black boys have you seen go looking for medication right you they don't right it's the adults who are inconvenienced by the child who say he needs to be tested you see that he's looking for no medicine yeah or no therapy he loves being who he is right so the first ethical issue is children don't refer themselves right it's adults that force them to get evaluated right it's adults that give them the ritalin the adderall the concerto the vibrance the metadata not the child right so when some people say i'm an adult and i have adhd the medication works for me right that's not a contradiction with the problem i have with childhood psychiatrics because you're an adult so you can refer yourself you can also speak eloquently as to the side effects that medicine is causing in you right but that eight-year-old can express the fact that i can't go to sleep because of this medicine right you know that uh my hunger my appetite is different because of this medicine right you see i'm sleeping too much because of this medicine that child isn't old enough to know that that medicine might affect his ability to have children later on life they don't know that that medicine is beginning to trigger psychotic symptoms right homicidal suicidal ideation so if an adult wants to take medicine that's your prerogative you're an adult you can protect yourself right an eight-year-old cannot the second ethical violation is it's all about the money the american psychiatric association is indebted to the drug companies they run it right do you hear me we talk about politicians being indebted to the corporations well the american psychiatric association is indebted to the drug companies right all of which publicly trade on wall street wow and they fund the diagnosis wow because they create these medications that need to be sold so they can make dividends for the investors right so they go to the apa and say listen we got a new medicine so you got to create a disorder defeat this medicine how much do they make off adhd meds a year 30 billion dollars 30 billion 30 billion dollars a year that's the drug game right it's the drug game speaking of that that's my third issue the drug enforcement agency of america classifies ritalin as a schedule two drug ritalin is in the same category as opium and cocaine this is the government wow ritalin is in the same category as opium and cocaine so let me get this right you got black men going to jail out the wazoo for selling crack right right most black men in jail are there for non-violent drug related offenses right if selling drugs are so bad if using drugs is so bad if it's bad enough to send the boy's father to jail how can it also be good enough to give to his son so he can sit still long enough to learn about helen keller and frank and christopher columbus if drugs are wrong drugs are wrong right you can't say it's wrong for adults to use them but we can give them to children so they can get an education that's the total contradiction crack is crack no matter what name you sell it under ritalin which is methylfinity okay is only a molecule away from crack it has the same side effects as crack ritalin is a molecule away from correct crack cocaine is synthesized coke wow you see so when they talk about you know a mass incarceration of black males and at the same time you're hyper etique hyper medicating black boys look at this you're mass incarcerating black men for selling drugs but you're hyper medicating black boys with the same drug that sent his father to jail right that is hypocrisy absolutely and no one's calling the united states department of education the pharmaceutical industry nobody's calling the american psychiatric association to task because so much money is being made from this nick everybody eats the psychiatrists eat the school eat the clinic eat the therapists eat even the parents can get social security money right everybody is eating off the modern day medical lynching mental health lynching of black boys wow and then the the concept of uh believing our community is uh a sick community or as they say you know it's easier to control a sick population uh and so but then defining what is sick uh has probably always been my issue and it's a very tough thing to do because there's a gray line in other words here's your clearly mental ill people right right and then you have a category of gray where people exhibit some symptoms but is he really conduct disorder is he really bipolar is she really borderline is this really depression you have these grays especially with depression because i feel like everyone has a a a hint of depression or goes through depression in their life at some time absolutely and then there's the actual disorder of oppressive disorder yeah so how do you determine if this is just a regular natural bout of depression that they should be allowed to work through on their own right versus rushing in to diagnose and medicate with the zoloft and the prozac right the drug companies want the psychiatrist and psychologist to rush in and diagnose because if you don't diagnose that script won't get written so they want everybody in the gray area to be included in the area with people who clearly have disability because they need prescriptions to be written right right it's the law of capitalism supply and demand we need a demand for these meds and the only way we're going to get a demand for these meds is if y'all diagnose people who really don't have the problem which is why in most states the psychologists and psychiatrists must diagnose something in order to get paid for the evaluation wow so you come in yeah i know this is just a regular bout of sadness or temporary depression yeah but i don't get my reimbursement from your insurance unless i diagnose you which is why i tell black folks to be careful because if you go sniffing for a diagnosis you're going to get one because most diagnoses that we use can't be proven to exist scientifically you understand when they create the dsm-5 that's the bible where all the diagnoses are yeah that's we talk about that a lot yeah that's not science that's not a scientific manual right they vote on committee oh wow over these disorders so none of that stuff is proven none of it's proven okay there is some research behind it but it's not conclusive right you see it's all about what is socially acceptable and financially lucrative to the drug companies wow so it feels like there's a lot of misappropriation and mental health in the term and even especially now even within our community we find it's almost become a buzzword yes and and you know a lot of drug companies love that yeah and people a lot of people have been accused of marketing mental health and making money even you in times they they would even say like different conversations my brother charlemagne a bunch of people who are actually stepping up and speaking about you know black men having mental health but i see there's this other side that's starting to say yes you know well why are we bringing that up or why are you it's almost calling it an excuse uh or another way to make money how do you feel about that okay if they're both right and they're both wrong we clearly have mental health issues in the black community clearly i know people who've been sexually abused i know people who've been verbally abused physically abused i know people are depressed anxiety disorders schizophrenia bipolar borderline suicide and you know black men and suicide is going through the roof by the way yeah i get a call i probably get six calls a year for black men who are either attempting or have successfully committed suicide this week i've already gotten two calls but this was not black men these was both black women wow so suicide for men and women are going up and suicide is the silent illness because people like to tell that they're suicidal and you don't even know that they were until they're gone right you see so we do have mental health issues the problem is what though nick we don't want those mental health issues to be exploited by the drug companies for profit because the drugs don't solve problems see when you get diagnosed with depression the best way to work with you and i'm a therapist is to talk you through that right let's find out the sources of your depression let's reinterpret them let's give them a meaning in your life that is more empowering than the one you have now let's switch out the beliefs that you associate with your future your past and your current situation let's move you out of that it's going to take some time right but the only way to do it is through traditional talk therapy right but the drug company has bullied the american psychiatric association into saying what everybody who gets diagnosed with depression must take meds you follow me so yes we're going to give you talk therapy but we need you to pop along with those acts right one of these laws why do you need the medicine at all because they got to make sure they get their cut because guess what in it if dr umar nick is a therapist we both therapists and we healing people with no medicine right that is a threat yeah to the profit margin of the drug company right they don't want you talking about we can solve this without the meds so they bullied the mental health system into telling everybody yes you need talk therapy but you also need some medication too here's the other point i want to make psychology has never been the friend of black people what do i mean by that do you realize that the segregation system white supremacy itself was born in the mind of the psychologist it was the psychologist who gave birth to black people are animals white people are gods what i'm saying it was uh uh and all their names are escaping me right now but all of the white fathers of psychology believed in african racial inferiority you've destroyed all of them uh darwin his cousin his cousin i love him so when you say black people need to go to the psychologists i'm saying you're sending them to the same people who engineered the popular beliefs of not only african racial inferiority but who also funded the eugenics movement that seeks to depopulate black people off of the face of this earth under the alleged notion that we have defective dna yeah see when you hear the news talk about are black men born to be violent you hear these conversations maybe they're just maybe this is who they are right that's eugenics eugenics wants to blame political problems okay on ancestral dna right so if nick cannon uh has adhd so called adhd because i don't believe in it right it's because of defective dna if dr umar johnson can't keep a job it ain't because the american social order hasn't created enough jobs for black men it's because he don't feel like working i'm lazy exactly if uh if i beat up my woman it's not because of the stress under which i live it's because uh it's that african chromosome you understand that's triggering that behavior so black people have to be careful because i'm starting to see black folks who mean well buy into this notion that mental illness is genetically programmed that's dangerous right because that's what slavery argued right that these people are backwards not because we made them that way because we have cut them off from any type of formal learning and socialization but because of defective dna feeble-minded absolutely that's that galton that's the sir francis sculpton yeah stock and he's worshipped in psychology he's a god in psychology he's one of the most racist psychologists who ever walked the face of this earth so when you tell us to go to the psychologist i'm concerned about that because psychology helped create the mental mindset that america operates under that is so responsible for so much of the oppression that we face and on top of that when you go to therapy there's a client therapist privilege right right you come to me for therapy i'm not allowed to disclose what you tell me right but there's a caveat right the system says if you say anything that's suggestive of the fact that you're committing child neglect or child abuse i got to report you right so i'm coming to you because i need to talk about these demons right but at the same time you're not telling me that if i say something that is potentially incriminating right you got to report me right and i can end up losing my children right because i came to therapy trying to get some help wow do you see that so for me it is the job of the black psychologists the black social workers the black counselors to evolve a mental health service system where we could solve the mental health issues of our own people because if you send black folks in mass to the white mental health system there's going to be more people it's more energetic more incarceration and more what drug addiction look at look at that you're going to get more drug addicts you're going to get more children snatched from there now the money just ain't going to the dope man it's going to the system the money going to the system you can't send people to get their problems solved by the same people that caused them so what is the answer i mean based off of because if not we'll self-medicate or if it and if the system isn't the answer um i mean obviously we can always say education but for someone a community that's obviously disenfranchised and there's so much going on we we see the resilience that that yes that we've been up against for generations but is there truly an answer or is this just a conversation like hey be aware because this is going going on but i feel like there's if the system's not the answer if if cultural self-determination is the answer let's look at what everybody else does when they come to america when the chinese show up when the arabs show ups when the european jew shows up uh when the mexican shows up the latino shows up the fact that they was already here right but the first thing they do is they create a political economic barricade around their interests right the minute they land they're not trying to integrate or participate fast they're trying to accumulate they're not trying to integrate or participate they want to accumulate right so hey oh atm machine absolutely most cities have a chinatown right most cities have a little italy yeah most cities have a jewish community yeah most cities have a latino community right even in philadelphia i live we're seeing cambodian communities a-rap communities yeah everybody got a town of they own in most major cities but there's no black town in america at all part of that is due to the psychological homelessness that slavery bred into black folks right we are ashamed about being black hence unapologetically african we don't want to be black in other words the one thing that becomes a positive weapon for most cultures right okay is actually a weakness for black people right because since our blackness has been the source of so much of our pain in america the last thing we want to do is rally around it in order to solve our problems right but there is no solution outside of group work there is no solution outside of teamwork any solution we come up with must be implemented systematically by way of the group it cannot be individualism so for example you'll hear people say according to forbes or according to the new york times there's 100 new black millionaires in america as of 2020 right right a negro who's politically uneducated will say that's a good thing there's a hundred more black millionaires but there's 50 million black people in america and very few of those 100 black millionaires are trying to reinvest any of that capital into systematic improvements for the race so how can you say black people are doing better because obama got elected how can you say black people are doing better because him and her are millionaires now no you judge group progress based on the average quality of life for all members of that race not a few negro aristocrats but in america they have convinced black people that progress for the negro aristocracy means progress for the group and that is incorrect yeah they said what the uh black wealth today is the same as it was when slavery ended absolutely when you compare to what white folks have in fact in many respects we've lost ground and we've lost a lot of that ground under a black president obama is not the scapegoat for everything that went wrong in black america but the one thing he must be held responsible for is he did absolutely nothing to impact any of the five major problems that we have as if i said i have that argument with people constantly because they're emotional right right it's like arguing you know was jesus the son of god and it doesn't matter to me whether they believe it or not because i respect our religion yeah if you want to argue whether muhammad ibn abdullah was god's last prophet doesn't matter to me or not because that's religion i'm into political power right yeah if the person is emotional they cannot entertain any logical argument you bring to that equation in fact so when you talk about obama since most black people deal with obamaism as a religion as opposed to a political mistake you can have a healthy conversation and they usually don't they don't have the the understanding or the knowledge of of politics in itself to understand if anything happened under under his reign or not absolutely and it's three key ideological mistakes black people make when it comes to electoral politicians mistake number one you don't get into politics to get you go into politics to protect why is every supreme court justice a millionaire why is nearly every senator a millionaire why has every president in american history been a millionaire at least in modern times because you get into politics to protect the wealth that you have black people want to spend their money on sneakers and jeans and clothes vacations and mercedes and hair and tims and then they want to go to the government and say give me what i need to do better but you just waste it right you understand 2 billion on ed jordan's last year 20 billion on hair care all right four billion on liquor you understand so number one we gotta stop looking at politics as a means of improving economically you get into politics to protect the wealth that we have that's number one number two we have to get out of this mindset nick that says i have to like you in order to vote for you you're a businessman i'm sure you've done business with people you don't like facts but it was mutually beneficial right right so you do it that's how we need to approach politics you don't exclude the republican because he's a republican right and you don't automatically endorse the democrat because he's a democrat you listen to them both and you choose the one who has an agenda that is closely aligned to the one you're trying to push but what if they're only pushing personality what if i that's the problem nick right personality means i got to like you right right do you understand so obama got elected by black folks because we like them because we like them i don't need to like you to do business with you if i got to strike a deal with donald trump for black empowerment i'll strike a deal with donald trump because what i'm not looking for is a black president or a black governor or a black mayor i'm looking for black power stop confusing the personality with the power right well what about but what if it almost goes down to understanding policy because again we vote on we vote on personnel that's what's presented to us most of the time the policies are never presented to us because even a lot of times you can even see donald trump didn't even know half of the policies but he knew how to cater to his his market therefore and the the lobbyists and all those people who actually write the policy i was like oh we can use him he can be that front runner to get these policies pushed through the presidency is a popularity contest facts black or white yeah we know that however people with high political iq can put the emotionalism to the side right and still objectively evaluate this potential candidate on the criteria right it's like going to church and you love the pastor you love his sermon but when that's over you still have a high enough political iq where you could say okay okay pastor i love what you said right but you are bringing in a hundred thousand dollars a month in this church what are we doing for the community around it right do you realize that in eight years in eight years barack obama was never questioned by black people a single time right as to what he would do to not change or solve but just improve right our condition on any of the five major factors which are what miseducation mass incarceration gentrification police genocide and access to wealth miseducation mass incarceration gentrification police genocide access to wealth obama didn't touch not one of them nor did we ask him to in fact he's the first president in american history who black people let do whatever they want in office without no consequences of criticisms he made history wow man and he used al sharpton to make any black person who had a question for obama to feel bad about asking that question so people say dr umar how can you evaluate obama as hard as you evaluate uh clinton or bush because they are all employees of the american white power structure right obama is an employee he doesn't represent the black community he's an employee right and because he's an employee of their system not mine i can evaluate him on the same lines as anyone else because i don't have a low political iq if i have a low political iq i say i can't question obama because he's black and that's how the negro aristocracy has survived so long exploiting black folks because they make you feel bad about asking questions questions wow that's deep so then what about that concept of are they saying whether it's obama clinton bush trump the hood always going to be the same i mean i remember i was out doing surrogate work trying to encourage people to vote and a brother literally came up to me and told me he was too broke to vote and and he knew it was going nothing was going to change and his truth to that yeah yeah and that's true and to that concept as we know the presidency is a popularity contest and you know we understand the importance of local government yes but in this situation like the average black man's life isn't going to change directly in in his mindset based off whoever the president because politics is not the central driving force of black liberation let me say it again politics cannot be the central driving force of black liberation it is a supportive strategy nick a part of that major black agenda it is not the black agenda but the naacp the urban league the congressional black caucus our black sororities and fraternities our graduates organizations the black church the negro aristocracy have made black people think that you can change everything if you elect the right person nobody else believes in that garbage and the reason why it's so easy to convince black people to believe that even negroes with a high political iq is because at the end of the day nick deep down inside of us we don't want the responsibility that comes with true liberation do you know what that would mean that would mean 25 percent of your take-home pay got to go into the black liberation fund you understand me yeah and then there will be people at your door to the collection do you understand me that means let's say you have uh 200 disposable hours in your work week right 50 of them is volunteering for the liberation structure right do you see what i'm saying you have this amount of money in your retirement well guess what we need 25 percent of that for this black hospital this black bank that we black folks don't want no accountability for liberation see voting is easy one time go home feel good about your vote church pray one time and go home but a true liberation movement requires sacrifice and accountability and we don't want to do both right i don't want to do anything for you and i damn sure i want you holding me accountable for what i didn't do right so the reason why politics is so important to black people is because we don't have any other strategies in play right right so based off but we are a lone ranger community we will vote or literally die because we ain't gonna do nothing else is that the lack of leadership it is the lack of leadership but i'm not going to put that totally on leadership that's half of it the other half of it in order for the leader to be effective dr king the most honorable markets messiah garvey malcolm x going all the way back all the way forward the people got to be ready for the leader to lead if dr king was with us today i don't know if he could do what he did 50 years ago because we ain't there right now right we all into this we're comfortable we comfortable i got a cell phone i got a laptop i got food on there i got food i got tim's on i got a bank card yeah and you know what's sad about that we have equated the trinkets of american civilization with freedom and the reason black people can equate the trinkets of american civilization with freedom nick is because we never experienced real freedom see if you had a real cheese steak a real philadelphia cheese if somebody bring you a cheese they can say this is a philly cheesesteak you know this ain't a philly cheesesteak cause you had one before right but if you've never tasted a philly cheesesteak somebody could sell you a fake one and you think it's the real one yeah that's how freedom is with black folks we've never had freedom nick in 400 years so when somebody comes and say having a cell phone and a phd in a house in a white suburb is freedom we believe it because we've never had true freedom wow that's why it's so easy to brainwash us so yes the leaders have been weak but the people have been even weaker right let's be honest not every black preacher is a pimp right but for those who are yeah you can't blame them totally for it their followers know they're pimping yeah and they're going there for that moment because what would you rather have if you were politically lazy negro do you want a preacher like dr king that's going to make you go out and face the police after the sermon or do you want a preacher that's gonna tell you just put a couple dollars in the bucket and i'll pray you to heaven and you ain't got to do no dr king protest because god is going to come and solve all this for us who do you really want in that pulpit you want the hustler all right because the hustler don't demand nothing from you right so the reason you can have all these black pimp preachers is because black people don't want to do no real work right you see so you say some of the criticism i get now 99 of our people love me in my work but that one percent that hates part of the hate is dr umar's trying to tell us we got to roll up our sleeves and work our way out of this right but the pastors say i could pray my way out right right the politician the congressional black caucus said i could vote my way out of this thing what this [ __ ] we're talking about i gotta stand up to the power structure and give my money and show up at the meetings i don't wanna do that right so what's really going on here is it's not that the misleaders are so effective right the people they're leading are just as disinterested in true freedom as they are yeah do you see nah absolutely but in the aftermath of dr king's assassination united states government reorganized black power they said we're not going through that number you got to realize right the 1960s politically bankrupted america do you realize j edgar hoover the c.i.a they had about 30 different legitimate black groups they had to fight go back to the 60s you had snick core the sit-ins the freedom rise unia nation of islam h rap brown stokely carmichael do you follow me and they was all serious and sincere right it overwhelmed the political structure of america so when they kill king they say we're never letting this happen again right and and then somebody said what can we do about it guess what they said two things you got to do if you want to crush the black power struggle number one you got to crush black men's economic power you got to crush black men's economic power in other words they engineered joblessness on the road to engineering mass incarceration because all of those groups i just named were funded by who independent black businessmen got it so they came into the high schools nick and they took out all the building trade programs the skills that pay the bills they took out the plumbing the carpentry the electric we wasn't all going to college in the 1970s right but we had good jobs and live decent lives because we had to skip kill ladies so they said we're going to go into the hood and instead of telling these black kids to go get you a trade we're going to tell them to go get that uh go get that master's degree yeah you see what i'm saying put them in debt put them in debt no jobs all debt that's what led to the unemployment which made it so easy for us to pick up the dope when the cia dropped it off in 1980 because there was no jobs so that is cia pumping crack and i got two choices i can sell it to feed my family or use it to deal with the fact that i cannot they engineered it so that was one thing engineer economic dysfunction for black males and the other thing we have to make our own leaders you can't let them come you gotta pick and choose right these leaders you understand so after they killed dr king they started grooming their own leaders right and then they said we're gonna put them in politics we're gonna put them in charge of the universities we're gonna put them in city government they still gonna be loyal to us yeah but they will represent an artificial form of forward movement for black folks and we have been under a dictatorship of false counterfeit black bourgeoisie leadership for 50 years wow are you aware that since dr king now dr king wasn't perfect he was not a pan-africanist but he's one of my heroes right because he's the last leader we had to give black people in this country a comprehensive broad-based grassroots struggle for political economic transformation you can't name a negro sin 68 that has given you a real movement with a real agenda with real objectives that was backed by more than just a good speech king was the last one which is why he's uncomfortable to me and what makes him even more unique is he had a doctorate yeah he was born into a privileged black church family right dr king could have been a td jakes or a creflo dollar he didn't have to give his life for black folks but here's a privileged black minister with a doctorate degree who decides even though i can fall back and preach and live comfortably i'ma dedicate my life to my people so what was that plan i mean it was it the was the poor people's movement the poor people's movement got him killed right not vietnam they didn't like him speaking against vietnam right that probably would have gotten killed right but it was the poor people's campaign yeah because dr king was going to take poor white poor black everybody right ahead of dc right and they were going to not come for a day this wasn't no march no one day march you understand they were going to live right live in the nation's capital erect a tent city and nobody was leaving until they had a house and a job you know what that's called economic revolution yeah they killed dr king because he made a shift after malcolm's death and he made a shift from civil rights to economic rights and when he did that that would have upset the power structure in america they had to kill him because there's only two black men who were more popular than the president at the time of their lives frederick douglass my blood relative was more popular than abraham lincoln and dr king was more popular than john f kennedy or lyndon baines johnson and when you have a black leader that is that powerful that he garners more attention and popularity than the president he got to go because what's the first rule in the 48 laws of power robert greene says don't outshine the frederick douglass and dr king outshine the master yeah and uh and i love where you where you take it uh but even just to put it into some context for you know some viewers that may not know the history and aspect of just even when we speak of they and the system um because you even speak of you know it it's a a 50 year old plan a century-year-old plan the idea of even if we want to talk about like you know centralized banking and the understanding of keeping everyone in debt whether it's college to mortgages the credit cards the system of that we are property not just black people but but everybody your birth certificate is is is really currency for this country that's true um that's true that idea of when you speak of they and them in that system the elite infrastructure is that is that all is that based off facts that's based off facts and and how does if that is based off facts how does that continue even to this day with so much information and knowledge that we are still up under that same oppression because the system remains the same the only thing they switch out nick is the content the system remains the same like does donald trump know he's operating that system the president is not an employer the president is an employee remember when barack obama got elected and it was a whole big thing over the fact that they gave him a blueberry and took his cell phone do you remember that yeah yeah if you're the employer don't nobody come and say give me your phone and take this one it seemed like trump still got hit but see the reason donald trump became president it was supposed to be hillary yeah presidents are chosen four to eight years in advance don't nobody vote no president in they never did right america is not a democracy right the word democracy is not in the constitution right the word democracy is not in the preamble the word democracy is not in the articles of confederation the word democracy is not in any of your 50 state constitutions right this is not a democracy it is a republic democracy is rule of the majority right republic is the rule of law and who establishes that law the elite right the white man did not come from britain because he wanted more political freedom the white man came from britain is because he wanted an opportunity to have a dominant dictatorship just like the one you wanted more the same you understand just like the american revolution they didn't fight that for freedom do you know why the 13 colonies opposed britain because britain had already enacted a law to begin the gradual elimination of slavery right the white man in america thomas jefferson and ben franklin george washington said how are you going to outlaw slavery we ain't done using it yet getting money the american revolutionary war this is fact the american revolutionary war was fought because the white man in america needed slavery to continue right and the crown was looking to eliminate it right it had nothing to do with freedom it was about keeping us in bondage but again they switch out the content nick but the system remains the same right you see you saw the situation that happened with the nfl the other day uh the browns versus uh the steelers yeah yeah and at the end the brother hit the white quarterback over here with the helmet he was wrong all right and he may even need a punishment for that right yeah but to be suspended indefinitely if that's the punishment i got an issue with that because i've seen white football players do worse two black football players on the field i remember i saw bill romanowski of the denver broncos spit in the face of another football player and got like a one-game suspension i'm not saying he don't get punished but let's go back and look at the film because i've seen black athletes get called the n-word by opposing teammates right why wasn't that an indefinite suspension right you see everybody knows the reason why it's indefinite is because the attacker was black and the victim was white but nobody's dealing with the fact that that white quarterback kicked him into growing nobody's dealing with the fact that he tried to take his health first do you understand but and i asked everybody the question if the quarterback was black and he was hit over the head by a star white defensive lineman would he have been suspended indefinitely we all know the answer is no all right there's a double standard in america and part of problem i have nick is i'm getting tired of black male celebrities volunteering to assassinate black masculinity by defending the things that white people do to black folks i'll give you a couple of quick examples not to put nobody on the spot but i'm doing it out there and i ain't got no issue with these brothers by the way i'm just showing you an example of dysfunctional behavior yeah i was watching skipping skipping shannon yeah yeah lil wayne was on there a couple years ago yeah this is right around the colin kaepernick situation yeah and skip asks lil wayne the question to the effect of what is your opinion on what's going on with the colin kaepernick piece police genocide race relations in america right and little wayne and i'm paraphrasing i don't want to get the brother's words wrong but he said to the effect that i'm the wrong person to ask right because i've never had to deal with that i had to replay that i said did a black man just say on national tv right that he don't have an opinion on racism because he never experienced any you are from what the seventh eighth ward of new orleans from the hood the hood right and on top of that chocolate brother right okay barack obama is the most privileged black man in american history even he's dealt with racism right he's the most privileged black man in american history even he's dealt with racism how can little wayne get on national television and say i'm not the person that asks about racism i think if defensive wayne wayne is on another planet though like i don't care what planet you are clearly has dealt with i mean he went to prison in new york for gun charges and the gun wasn't even why say i'm not the one to ask i'm not throwing him under the bus but i'm saying this is an example of an influential black personality a black male but it goes back to what you were saying of we're scared to not only uh ask questions but answer questions in that idea to me that is a self-inflicted assault on our own black masculinity we almost don't want to have an opinion because we know we don't have to deal with the consequences absolutely and that means that's anti-masculinity don't you yeah yeah because part of being a masculine part of being a man is being courageous and assertive because that's why i thought you were going with it even with a lot of the celebrities and even i get flack for being so outspoken and and standing firm on masculinity and yes and the way i father and the things because now if you say something about protecting your daughter or if you say something about uh being assertive uh to whether it's your own children or in the workplace then they want to they want to attack you they want to they want to bring you be willing to accept that because had it not been for black people who came before us to accept those types of attacks for being unapologetically african we would not even be here there's no examples of that today it's and that in that in that field i'll follow you but even if you don't have those examples in your everyday life they're in our history yeah everyone knows what nat turner did everyone knows what harriet tubman did everyone knows what martin delaney i'm busy chasing the bag that's true but that does not justify or excuse your behavior yeah i give you one more and then i want to give you one where i felt the brother did a good job okay stephen a smith this was year before last villanova had just won the national basketball championship yeah the white boy from villanova i believe he was an italian he's an nba now he won mvp right it came out later that he was using the n-word i don't know if he was a rapper or he was in the conversation he used the n-word right and so it made national news right stephen a smith volunteered to be his defense attorney to the black media and started talking about how much he didn't mean to use the n-word it was taken out of context and hip-hop that word is used and i'm watching a black man on national tv defend a white man's right to use the n-word without even being asked to do so i give you another one when eminem when some of eminem's old lyrics was discovered remember that and he was calling black girls dumb and ugly or whatever rapper after rapper without even being asked by eminem to defend him rushed to the radio and started defending a white man's right to use the most horrific the most gruesome and the most grotesque word ever used to defend black folks that is anti-masculine behavior you don't ever go on the defense of your oppressor against your own people and then here's a positive example t.i yeah he had what's what's that guy the uh he deals in that alien stuff michael uh uh on the show he had the guy what's his name uh ali uh trying to think what are you talking about he deal with the aliens and the people from mars and the reptilian agenda one of those anyway the guy was going in on candace owens oh right right t.i had just did a thing with the platform with candace they disagreed yeah yeah what i loved about what t.i did though nick is he he was trying to coach t.i to throw candace under the bus because they disagreed right right but t.i exercised black masculinity and told him that even though i disagreed she's still my sister right and i support her right he killed it right there right right he didn't have to attack the white male or anything he just let it be known that even if she and i disagree she's my sister and i support her all i'm saying is we have to do a better job as black men of defending the respect of our community because i'm getting sick and tired of us volunteering to protect the status quo so then that brings up a good conversation uh too and i think we we touched on it here and there throughout throughout the this session is there tends to be especially in the conscious community you have highly educated uh full of wisdom and knowledge individuals but for some reason we tend to use this information uh to almost be boastful and and as a competition uh and we find ourselves that you know i have this belief i'm a pan-africanism believer i'm i'm a i'm a believer and whatever your your religious or political beliefs are and then we find ourselves using our platforms to challenge yes disgracing each other based on in public in other words here we go again so you got the brothers gang banging on the street right right now we go into black consciousness right right all you did was switch out the what the identity and the ideology right right yeah so instead of [ __ ] blood is now pan-africanist socialists yeah nation of islam guys on earth yeah nawapi in hebrew and i'm not saying they're gangbanging i'm just using them you know samples right doing it in public and we're doing it in the things where at a time like this in social media when martin and malcolm be going at each other absolutely on instagram well well martin and malcolm wouldn't go at each other because martin and malcolm were both sincerely committed to the struggle one one caveat i would add to what you're saying because i totally agree with you it is wrong and it's anti-progressive but let us be clear about something my brother nick cannon most of the personalities that you see in the black conscious movement very few of them are sincerely committed to the struggle there's very few dr cars you understand dr umar johns this few many of them are hustlers and because black consciousness is now a new hype thing right they're hustling the consciousness it's no different than when spike lee came out with malcolm x movie in the 90s and everybody went out and got a mock-up malcolm x hoodie malcolm xt where is that now in the 1960s everybody got the black leather they red black and green they afro where is that now i'm telling you that black consciousness is being exploited by opportunists in the streets for financial gain right and if you say that's a pretty strong charge the levy against these brothers and sisters right right and there are exceptions i could prove it real simple okay do a survey of all of and ask them two questions two things what are those two questions what are you currently changing to make things better for african people and what are you building to make things better than african people either you are building an institution to serve us or you are actively engaging in the changing of some narrative right or system so that we can more accurately prepare for our future it's either one or the other if all you do is sit on youtube and make videos do you follow what i'm saying right or have cultural events and festivals but you're not building no institution or changing no institution then you are an opportunist right it's as simple as that you must be building or you must be changing wow it cannot just be i'm a youtube chief teacher right so i mean i think that even gives you uh an opportunity to to talk about the things that you're doing i mean asking yourself those two questions and sharing i mean obviously and i'll start with the building yeah yeah uh february of this year we purchased a four building campus in wilmington delaware uh for the frederick douglass and marcus garvey leadership academy which will be america's first school for black boys based exclusively off of revolutionary pan-african nationalism and international economics i am getting away from the narrative that the primary purpose of public school nick is to prepare kids to get accepted into college right because as we said earlier college is putting us into debt right you have over two million african americans in this country right now with master's and doctorate degrees not bachelor i'm not talking associates i'm talking masters and doctorates who cannot find work so the narrative that in elementary or middle high school exists so i could go to school is counterproductive because school ain't guaranteeing black folks no employment you know how many resumes i got on my laptop from black folks emailing me talking about i'm looking for a job engineers lawyers can't get paid wow because they economically devastated us back in the 70s and 80s by stripping the skills out to school to put you into debt so we're changing that narrative at fdmg okay we're going back to the book of t what is the answer back to vocational concepts that's a part of it right see when you talk about nation building you got to have a little bit you got to have all of it i'm not saying don't send no black kids to college because there's certain professions that require college training right engineer doctor psychologist if you ain't going to college you can't be right so i'm not saying not to send some but to send everybody mike mike ray ray and john john he barely got out of high school he wanted to go to howard do you understand me do you if you barely got out of high school i do your family you won't be going exactly but parents are doing it because they believe in order for them to look successful their children got to go to college so they would rather go into debt to save face with other negroes and make the best decision for their child wow so with the frederick douglass marcus garvey academy i want all your listeners to know that if they want to support our work they can donate and they can send a check of money order payable to the fdmg academy to po box 9634 wilmington delaware i repeat fdmg academy po box 96 34 wilmington delaware or you could donate on the cash app by going to cash dot me slash dollar sign fdmg school i repeat the arm on the cash app is dollar sign fdmg school my ancestor frederick douglass once said that it is better to raise strong children than to repair broken men so when you say where do we start to fix this nick yeah part of where you start is with the children i think that we do not allocate black community resources effectively we spend 85 percent of our attention trying to fix grown folks right in the meantime the children are becoming more dysfunctional because they're not getting the attention i'm not saying give up on the adults i'm not saying give up on ray ray and taytay yeah what i'm saying is most of your attention should go on the child not the adult because as a psychologist right by the time you five your personality is long yeah by the time you're 15 you ain't likely to change by the time you're 25 you can forget it and 35 whoever you are you're gonna die that way so why are we trying to change people whose personalities are largely fixed right when you have babies who have not yet formed their personality so it's more about the cradle to prison pipeline than the school of prisons you get them before they get it oh absolutely before they get this question absolutely because that's that's what you're gonna build what type of person they're gonna be in the other movement so that's what i'm building right because i'm doing both i'm garvey so we action so that's the school right and if anybody wants to work at the school they can send me their resume fdmg resumes gmail.com and here employing us without question and we're looking for people who got unique skills nick that can benefit our children what do i mean by that you might not be a licensed teacher but you might be a farmer we can use that you might not be a licensed teacher but you might uh be into uh animals right we can use that you understand you might know how to make clothing we can use that you might know how to build websites we can use that we want our boys to graduate nick being able to earn skills and over 20 different skills right even if they never go to college right we will have an economic science curriculum they would be taught real estate international investments stock market they would be investing in penny stock third grade wow we're not playing games we're not playing games because for our women to respect us again let's understand something the contempt that the black woman has for the black man nick to some extent is it is justified it's justified why is that because when she look at other women she see that their men can do things for them that we can't do for them don't get me wrong that's not all i thought we didn't ask to be here none of the institutions that oppress black men are ruled by black men we don't rule the prison system we don't rule the school system we don't rule the economic system so it's not all our fault right but i understand what a sister is coming from and if we want to change the way our women value us then we're going to have to economically empower ourselves so they can come to us with our needs and we can say sister i got you right we got to be able to walk into these department stores and fast food restaurants where we see black women being disrespected daily right by anglo-saxons to arabs and say sister you don't need this come on i got a job for you and not only take her to the job but not try to get any shooky nookie on the way to the job do you understand that that's right so we can fix let me give you this point you know why nobody really feels sorry for black america despite everything we go through the trayvons and the sandra blands and the jail in the schools we're the only african population on the planet nick on the planet that can solve their problems themselves no other african population can solve their problems themselves with the exception of maybe canada or the united kingdom right but most african communities are dependent to some degree on the government for intervention not us we are two trillion dollar people not us what's going to happen next friday what's going to happen next friday in america it's black friday yeah and guess what negro's going to do in philadelphia we're going to spend 3 billion listen to this i didn't say million i said billion in philadelphia pennsylvania the fifth or sixth largest city in america we're going to spend three billion dollars on christmas can i ask you a question yeah if philadelphia has a population of 1.5 million half of that is black so we about 750 000 right and if we're going to spend 3 billion in philly being a population of 750 000 could you imagine what the new york city black christmas bill was going to be can you imagine what the chicago black christmas can you imagine la and houston right here and do you understand me so how are you going to cry about not having good schools poor healthcare no jobs no banks no supermarkets no factories when you're wasting billions of dollars on garbage man we got it do you see so you can take the slave out of slavery all day long but until the slave takes the slavery out of himself he will never be free it must be a psychological revolution nick before any other revolution if you don't change the way we think about ourselves our future and our oppressor nothing changes the mind is the first place to make the change what did dr carter g woodson say in miseducation of the negro he said if you control a man thinking you don't have to worry about his actions if you bring him to the house you don't even have to tell him to go to the back he'll go on his own and when he gets to the back if there is no door he will make the door and walk out of it that is how dr woodson also said it took him 20 years to undo the mental side that harvard university put inside of him the most honorable marcus garvey said don't take the kinks out of your hair take the kinks out of your mind so i'm saying we have to have a psychological revolution before we have an economic revolution spiritual revolution political revolution social revolution change the african mind tear it down and build it up and that's what we're going to do at fdmg man well you unpacked a lot and it's just the beginning man uh it's an honor to sit with you and build with you on this level definitely got to do it again but i i'm i'm inspired uh i'm driven and i know uh a lot of the people listening and watching are definitely gonna do the same so much continued success thank you brother thank you man dr umar johnson it's a revolution ,2
hcwfc6NwGh4,[Music] that's the zone because even a lot of interviews you go especially like in a hollywood and a la uh situation um the whole setup of being set up the whole setup is a setup they trying to get something out you they trying to get a sound bite they trying to say something opposed to being on a vibe somebody stand up you got to tell them shut up the whole setup is a setup hey boy get up let up we fed up i'm going head up i'm not going to join him this bars he's going crazy right there he's going yay yeah but they have it where they'll have a person that's just there just to antagonize black people right and we're used to us getting ripped apart so what i'm saying is like we say walter van buren dunker anybody even like black designers i know for me like like everybody been jealous of um everybody that's designed a lot of people that have designed this a lot of people have been jealous of virgil because he got that spot that's the number one spot so everybody can be frustrated you know but when i spoke out on twitter that was not christ-like you know that's why i had to go to my wife and say um you know i didn't cover you the way the way that i i should have and i even said something because we were listening to a christian a playlist and it was all these like new edition songs stuff i was like well she is good at black playlists but you say that and we have a good time man we laugh and stuff but on on quite often we share share scripture and words of inspiration with each other and one thing that sits on me one time is like i love proverbs and like proverbs 2 2 says turn your ear to wisdom in your heart to understanding and i feel like that's what i don't know i tell myself that daily and i feel like i've shared that one with you and and we talk you know cause i always say utilize your voice be the leader that you are you've proven people so proven people wrong so many times so that they don't understand you so when we seek our own understanding through through the word uh it has to like we connecting in a different way but other people ain't going to understand it they've caught they they've called both of us coons they've called us crazy they call these all of these names but when you see like two brothers having a friendly conversation i feel like anybody can tap in and understand that yo this is a man who who loves his family it's a man who has passion for for art for for create creative ideas anything in a creative space but why do you think that you you're so misunderstood when trying to seek your own understanding i just think i say what i feel and i keep it real in a phony situation so that looks wrong truth to power that's what that is yeah that just looks wrong to people you know like uh let's take when i met with jared kushner yeah let's talk about that in colorado yeah cause they said there was a secret meeting that you guys set up in that yeah and ain't no secret he's using you as a puppet that's what they're saying yeah so the thing is i'm not one of these i'm black so i'm democrat 95 95 of black people are democrat yeah i wanted to meet with bernie sanders before he wouldn't meet with me now i'm fine to meet with biden i mean he probably with me with biting right now i would be with anybody i love everybody jesus loves everybody i love kamala harris that's a personal friend hu howard you know but uh but i understand like these this politics is and you you just want to talk to people who share your passion yeah well you know i met with jared that's a that's a friend of mine i knew them before they was in the white house right trump used to go to award shows of puff daddy that is true we all used to put trump in our raps people i was that was that was the american dream to ball out like trump i always remember who someone has been to me um you see i'm saying like that's why when i had an opportunity to do nasa's album this person made ill-matic in fact people was bugged out because it was like you could you even gave him a better album than you gave yourself it's like this man nas is like one of my heroes right he was one of my father figures right nas was one of he was my he was my brother he was he was a uh uh he was my my stylist from a distance what fresh cut what what would nas wear how would nasa cut his hair yeah you know uh and so when i had an opportunity to make music for him i'm gonna give everything i got my grandfather used to say if you're a janitor be the best janitor that you can be and what i like about producing is producing has always been a service position to say let me find something that's going to be in service to you so let me talk about the jared thing i always feel like i keep getting pulled over in my fancy car like when i was 19 i got pulled over for driving a white expedition i had braids peli jacket and when my mom uh came to bail me out um i saw on the police report it said cream ford explorer uh that was crossed out and it said white expedition so i wasn't even the one they looked they just got close enough yeah and they they threw me in jail okay i meet with jared kushner and everybody want to ask me questions this is my this is my expedition i'm driving i ain't got to tell you i don't care if we got ice cream i can meet with whoever i want you know why because i'm free right and so many black people so many people are just not free right i have the freedom to vote for who i want i have the freedom to meet with whoever i want like for me it's like i got friends just like well because of the riots i i know a bunch of people that's like oh we like trump now and then after the riots it was like we hate trump we just got to do everything we get them out i mean it's the protests and all that that's appropriate but let me tell you something people keep on saying i think that y'all you and republicans are in cahoots and cahoots they saying that they paying you to to do what you're doing to be a distraction bro can't nobody pay me you got more money i got more money than trump so you doing this praises through god yeah so what is the purpose of meeting with jared kushner what is the purpose of you know by the way i don't need no purpose now the thing is i have a reason that people would like like that man came out with a printed copy because he couldn't get the paperback version of dr claude anderson's book the power nominee for paranomics and he said so wait jared kushner had power in omics jared kushner talking about black empower comics and had notes red lined underlined quoting lines awesome so anybody who's not familiar with claude anderson this is a dude who's been started in education and just been building for the wealth of black people and the empowerment of black people closing the wealth gap for so long he's one of the things from power nomics that i always relate to is when he talks about blacks are the only people in the united states that don't have communities they're like we occupy residential areas you know what i mean but everyone else has their own community and this is the plan right here claude anderson has a four-year plan to rebuilding the black community right that is what we talked about that's what you and jared talked about yeah but i don't care if i talked and you got some ice cream i could get ice cream that's what i'm saying i don't have to justify right none of my actions period yeah you're because you're free you're free i'm not no housekeeper right what what what has biting done for me that's so special what has he done for me that's so special to make me vote for this man and i don't care about likability right so then and this is you're speaking i'll be frustrated because let me tell you who the most racist the liberal racist when a white person could tell me you gonna split the vote better not step past the line boy right so now but let me tell you here's the one here's the one deep yeah here's the one so this is what this is where i go to a place and that's why i even i i brought up this book by the the great dick gregory god russ is so uh he's our ancestor now but in 1968 one of the most pivotal years like 2020 he ran for president i wouldn't mind the first four years of me that's what so he that's what dick gregory said and he said to be forced to select between a two dominant uh party choice is to have no real choice at all and it's almost that goes back to like what w.b du bois says there's no such thing as two parties there's just one evil party with two names so you are stepping out as pretty much what the declaration of independence says is when you see a flawed government you gonna speak to it for the people but people are saying you're a distraction and because they don't want four more years of trump maybe you might i don't i i don't but but you want an alternative of four years of yay is that realistic right now in 2020 well god has made unreal things happen i'm here for you many times is it realistic for me to be here nah you know you done you didn't cheated death several times you didn't accomplish what most people said you would never accomplish you certified yourself as a multi-genius and a multi-billionaire we just came up with multi geniuses but no because i had people keep on telling me man it's just rude to call yourself a genius okay how about a multi genius and that's something people don't understand yay's sense of humor so he like this all the time and they will say oh well there he go acting crazy again and saying crazy things when really you have a different perspective and you come from it from a place where you're not really trying to this that's what i'm going to say like when people all right so look at this right so this i was wearing it walking through the domes and the ranch all right but i could wash these off and it'd be brand new yeah box fresh now i i saw people talking after the i just saw black people on tv like ridiculing me and dissing me for crying on tv and i you know the whole thing about the harriet tubman thing is we we don't need to tear our statues down to build new ones because we don't got enough statues that's what it is but the only icon is jesus but what i want to say is those people that's ridiculing me bro yin design this come on man so they can't but okay so if they if they ain't make dark fantasy no no dark fantasy and watch the throne right and cruel summer talk your talk and good fridays and late registration i'm just talking about just 12 months i'm just talking about 12 months oh you're right you're right i'm talking about 12 month period yeah i had a friend man i ain't going to go we could edit this out but i was saying that and he was like man cruel summer's trash i said boy you ever made something like mercy mm-hmm like but that's okay so what about all those people who are saying cause granted all of those are genius moves but what about the people are saying you are out of touch so that you can't that's the dream come true but as a leader as someone who's supposed to be guiding people and running for president they want somebody they can relate to so exactly so am i out of touch when i break down at the drop of a dime or the thought of aborting my daughter but some people can say that's instability some people though oh look yay needs needs help because i would say that the world is what's unstable america is what's unstable it would be 100 accurate 22 million 500 000 black people have been executed through abortion culture every so many things that are for the culture do it for the i do this for christ boy this ain't for the culture this is for jesus christ so what about people saying you're a little too religious especially to be running for office uh that's that's what we need and that's who i am and i always been who i am and it's worked out thus far right and i shall be president at some point in our lifetime so maybe not 2020 so what about j 2024 because now because kamala in there i know you don't like biting but you know that to see a woman operating a black woman from oakland went to hbcu to be in the white house you got to want to support that you got to want to see that that's a good thing for the culture and you can follow up 2024. is it a good thing for christ what's your position i i don't know that's a great because when you're a democrat you're not allowed to talk about christ republicans are allowed to talk about christ democrats not allowed to talk about martin luther king was a republican right blacks used to be the republicans back then absolutely blacks used to be and if you're a christian you're most of your values going align with republicans more now you're such an out-of-the-box type of person and you talk you got your own party now the birthday party why why does this is our party this is not just my party our party this is our party the birthday party and and and it's funny because it reminds me of one time we was on and this is when i got kanye we were young we were one of the recording academy packs both trying to get get our grammy grind on and it was a bunch of kids and he was like yo people always treated me all my life you know like tell me to be quiet and all that stuff and he was like no i live my life like it's my birthday it's like you ever go to like chuck e cheese or show biz or whatever and they'd be like yo you making too much noise over there he's like i'm supposed to make this look it's my birthday and i was like i understand him now like he lit you've cheated death you've done something to you you've been that quiet kid in the back so if i was never married to death how can i cheat we've people don't even know you have more than one car accident and things of that nature of like you we've seen you beat the odds many times in so many ways and so that's why you're so outspoken when i said i was gonna run for office and people asked hillary clinton before she ran and they said what do you think about kanye running for office her response was i wouldn't want to run against him who would and when i said so they're scared of you mainly is what this is yeah because the funny thing is even though blacks due to abortion not due to kanye west due to abortion are only we are only thirteen percent of the entire population the entire in america yeah of the vote you know that 13 can make a difference if you ask lewis hamilton that small percent could be the difference in especially when we have the influence the influence that you have and do you see that as a responsibility because you're speaking on some heavy topics from abortion from economics to these things now you know even more so with children when people hear you speak they want they want you to to speak in a direction that one gets rid of the oppression that this administration has put upon our community people live in a sound bite community a sound bite culture where you think one line is going to change everything not no one like do you know how long me and jared sat there and went through uh point by point from claude anderson's book and the time i spent on the phone with claude anderson's wife for the time i spent talking to charlemagne about this this is just the beginning of a journey when we talk about sustainable you know they get all these the democrats are really good at using or the left are really good at using social media to try to cancel people to try to bring them down to try to discredit i think it's four d's it's discredit dismiss yeah and i saw you you wrote you wrote to me about that you know the i i feel like i made a steal like i can't even be you can't be canceled like i can't be cancer but also like i couldn't be hurt i felt like i couldn't be hurt anymore right until you know we we spoke about the idea of aborting my daughter and then that's when you got vulnerable like that that's when i was like i had to i had to i had to feel that because i feel that people might say i'm out of touch because i'm not letting the smoke screen stop my decisions to move forward think about the way the slaves was always controlled it was so many more slaves than the slave master but we were we were brainwashed and we still are right and that's in the past statements when you've made statements whether it's about harriet tubman or even slavery being a choice that's what you were pretty much touching on is like we were brainwashed and we were controlled by the system like carter g woodson says uh once you control a man's mind you don't have to worry about his actions and that's the thing they're not controlling my mind so they're worried about my actions and uh and i'm these are not reactions god is using me and god covers me and won't nothing happen until he's done with me right i mean that's evident the fruits of your labor are evident look the um what about the people who say the devil is because the earth is you know the devil's domain and his dominion and all of that stuff and he said just like the devil tempted jesus and said you can have all i can give you all of these things in the earth do you see like is because i've seen that as well as like oh that's the devil that's the devil especially some of them super duper church going type of christians they want to go oh that's not chris they they hate on sunday service they say oh no that's the devil that's the world that's secular playing and and and being a facade for what christ really is i mean a lot of people got opinions on how to represent christ and some people they argue about the image of christ because you have an abundance you know what i mean like i always said come so you got life and have it abundantly but jesus was me at the same time people were saying oh god told you this god told you god that how god told you god told you but through me god showed you come on bars god told you before me god showed you hey what are we talking about and by the way it it even if i had to go through what job went through where everything goes away you know what i'm saying when i when i because and the reason why that joe went through that is because he feared all of those things you don't have no fear man i see mandela's prison cell and i'm like all right we would ever we would whatever we're not afraid of death 27 strong ones and for his people yeah we're not afraid of prison we're not afraid of death we're just not afraid we ain't going that's period now let me explain something about with me i'm a freedom fighter so my comment to harriet tupman or of her was yeah we got clean more we got to be reminded of how white people did us dirty yeah or how we were slaves or even go to african american history museum they don't start off with the african drums it starts off with the slave boats because i mean it depends what door you going it could be it could be more motivational but they don't they don't they they don't want us to get i say this all the time you're not wrong when they say well our our culture is much more than slavery and that's when we want to talk about you know if we have black history month we need to have black future month just like just like that uh you know i make black history every day i don't need them on i would we was there when yeah i think you gave me that bar i gave him that seat i told y'all i told y'all i gave him the bar but in that sense you you've always exemplified that and it goes back to like you know the richest man that ever lived this is this is who if you ever did a movie or you had irritation you should uh be uh the sultan of mali mansa musa is to this day he his gifts threw off the economy in the 1300s just the richest man ever lived richard and jeremy was like in the trillions but he was an african in in the 1300s he was explorer all of this type of stuff but they they don't teach us about those type of individuals because they want to start with slavery because everything looks better from slavery if you start that flavor everything's going to look like that progress don't give you nothing and if you just get a little sip of water then you look like a horse with a sugar best water i ever had that's how they be happening so they so why don't so that's the whole thing like they don't they show us that we're more than slaves see when people say oh the republicans paying kanye that's like you acting like they got more money than me you acted like i could be paid right bro i saved 100 million in taxes this year right i saved 100 million in tax in taxes right this ain't got numb to deal with one thing i know i know yay for a long time can't nobody tell him to do anything he don't want to do can't nobody convince him with no money he can't nobody convince him it's he's gonna do what he wants to do and it seems that your passion was to show people how much you care i never did it for the money but the funny thing is people call me crazy and they discriminate against people with mental illness or mental mental health abilities right mental abilities because it's actually an ability it's a superpower tell me it's an illness right because i'm seeing the truth inside of a phony world and then people want to lock her up lock me up they want to lock me up for expressing myself do nothing but i don't even do anything but express myself and i'm gonna get hit with the needle and and throne you know what would happen if i got thrown in a crazy home it would drive me crazy that's normally what happens that's what it like and even the infrastructure of what big pharma is and how they you know even from young black boys they always want to diagnose them with something whether they diagnosed me with adhd when i was a kid because they want to get you hooked on drugs early they want to say that they want to give you put you in special education when really you're just on a different frequency and you're on a different way so let's talk about that the fact that people have called you crazy do you see that as irresponsible well i just see that that's a new discrimination that people have to understand because there's even people that are mindful of the word crazy like how post me too men were very cautious in the way we didn't we get you got you got to be careful with your compliments and so now people are sensitive to it and so now whenever i express myself the only problem is people will be quick to be like oh he's going through something and then they try to discredit what i'm saying and we talk about credit a lot of times credit deals with money well i've never cared about money and then people started calling me crazy so then i said you know what i'm gonna do i'm gonna go out and just make more money and y'all gonna stop calling me crazy because i get to a billion you can't call me crazy yeah and then it was two years where i wasn't called a billionaire and then i came out three billion right they even forbes exposed themselves and showed like how i was talking to say y'all can't count right i better count that up count that up again forbes and i really when when bloomberg was coming i just thought about nike and louis vuitton i said yeah i bet you i can get forbes and bloomberg to deliver the message at the same time like when nike and louis vuitton uh delivered and they did but i that's why i like love i love man forbes is some of my favorite white supremacists man they cold bro this is about this like my most favorite white supremacist is forbes uh is tell me why yeah because bro i just gotta like respect they gangster bro cause they they don't live in 2020 they act like it's 18 you know hunted still because they'll be like read the forps it's crazy racist every time they write stuff and people and people would do articles but it'd be like so but now what they keep moving they still in business right so bloomberg was coming and they had an accurate net worth of 3.3 billion and forbes purposely landed an article to dispute that and said well the way we counted it's 1.3 and they dropped it at um 505 or something right at the end of the week so that would go into to the weekend to the weekend right and that would be the story that that it was confusion they could just cause confusion that's something the devil could do is like call devil is the author they're confused they they authored confusion they offer and the funny thing is the guy will still text me and he'll be talking about his daughter i'd be like tell your daughter you got a cool dad and then he'll write an article it's like like you know the funny thing i i was going to curse because i'm like [ __ ] you yay but i really realized just like when you when you say curse what you really do run out of words so let me tell you so i'm thinking people calling me crazy so i'm gonna show them i'm gonna even show my big bro i'm not crazy i'm gonna show jay-z i'm a you know i'm gonna show them that you know that my value that you could be diagnosed and people could point fingers at you and you could still be a citizen and you can still have value he said don't let that stigma define who i am i didn't let the stigma define who i was so the funny thing is so i'm like boom it's gonna be you know they're gonna see that you know i i ate them i ate up all my vegetables i did the right thing and i got up to 3.3 billion i have all my vegetables look guys i'm not crazy look guys i ate up all my vegetables i got three point three and then it's like that guys i got five billion i have all my vegetables and then i cried for my daughter and now he's crazy and they said he's crazy again so that that made me tell us like forget valuing money in that way because i thought that if i would become a billionaire that it could help me beat the stigma but it was because i it's funny because i got friends that soon as someone says oh yeah ain't take his meds or this that they could be like you ain't need to take your and they can send me and it's literally wow like how people would treat black people 100 years ago wow people who are diagnosed can get treated like black people were treated now we're more subtle deep that's deep like nah cause even when you say that because as someone who they've you know called me crazy and you know said i had mental health issues and someone who's actually dealt with many people my family and that thing where that stigma that's placed on you can drive you to a place of depression or um and who who are they to say that you are crazy or who are they to say that you just having a moment and i guess because i feel like i know you and i you know i know the the frequencies we be on like it's not about being defined and that's where it even goes back to the the politics like why do we have to classify or identify with what you deem to be normal and people all human beings have a opportunity to go crazy without being defined as crazy right like when people go to a soccer game they go crazy they go crazy so you put me in certain environments my family would come with me and be paparazzi follow us around and they say what'd they say i couldn't do this i go crazy like there's no human rights in the world i couldn't live your life that would drive me crazy drive me crazy right and so i saw the other side and come back and now it's like a superhero because i really can understand how to use this heightened sensitivity because that's all it is to get more work done think about all the people who have done great things in history think about einstein yeah was was noah crazy when he was working on the the ark as he said don't listen to him no just keep building your art just keep just keep building the ark because by the way it's like even this i i the whole i i speak from the future to the future so even right now this is just documentation that might only make sense to some in the future oh no it's going to be classic it's a classic one right and that because what people always do every time something happens what people got to do go to my old interviews because my only my old interviews can apply to now the majority of the things that i'm saying don't even apply to now yay talking to the future he's teaching us from the future absolutely if you're living in the president if you're living in the future then the presence is your past my presence is the president kiss my ass bars but that's the thing man like and and to relate back to the identity of you know because that's the thing everybody want to talk about is what's going on with yay for 2020 is is you've cleared it up with the whole jared thing and that trump's not paying you and you're not the republicans aren't using you you're doing this solely for the people can we talk about that next step the republicans and the democrats they couldn't afford me bro so let's talk about where you put in the money yeah the children man like and and i really want you to touch on your your love and compassion like we we touched on the heavy subject of abortion but let's talk about the orphanage and the idea of what you want to do moving forward since we talk in the future and even while we're sitting here in wyoming or what you really want to do for what i like about this whole thing is it can be just like how we do a verse because it could be things we kind of hit a point like six seven times in an interview and you said i might wanna hit that twice yeah yeah and it's other things you can hit it in so um we're building plan a and people could say how are you building planet well plan a is exactly what you think about you know planned parenthood and plant plan b well this is plan a and it's exactly what you think that would be that would be given stipends that's creating an orphanage so right now i'm donating my land to build an orphanage all of these acres that we're sitting on right now yes wow so um and that's an openness for for kids from all over the world well it's just to look at orphanages you know we've difficulty yeah we look at them a different way like when i made this foam runner or when i made jesus or mma 808s just to have an opportunity i'm a creative that's the way god uses me through my anointing is due creating with these interviews they'd be funny to me though because i get to create in an interview yeah you painting the picture yeah the interview i i don't know if i you know what people say he's not the best communicator no y'all just don't want to hear what i'm communicating and it's too busy they'll be trying to cut you off and get to the point that's why i hear you have an open forum we chop it up like we chop it up on the phone oh yeah and my new thing is just if someone asks me a question don't give away the secrets don't give it away then they gonna jump in there and try to try exactly exactly not but man to be able to i was like like you live i've watched you from from when your career started to where you are now and everything you put your mind to everything you said you were gonna do you did you know what how everything i put my heart to everything i put my gut to if my heart is in it it's gonna work if my mind if it was just my mind a lot of times people put their mind into delegation let me delegate this let me not put my heart into that that's that time when you are in front of it it's funny it's like with my children i have to be in front i have to be there i have to be present not just the dad that comes with the cool presents uh i have to be present not just the dad just comes with the cool presents um uh a dad or jesse and i have to speak up not just a dad with the cool presents triple entendre for you all one time so because sometimes i've had to speak up i've had i've had to raise my voice certain times on things that i stood for morally right and it's there was a there's a fight for our soul right you know like i struggle with pornography from six years old right um so if i see i remember i went to the library and i and i started taking out all the books that had um you know sexual imagery in it right it wasn't just specifically nudity it could be a swimsuit picture that was hype very hyper sexual right bro it was crazy it was like half of the library because we'll put like a big coffee table book because it's cool in it right and it was like half you know naked woman on the front and then you open it and it has naked and we're so used to that kind of culture that we don't realize that sex is a drug right and when you orgasm what is it endorphins yeah you're releasing all of you and that endorphin is very similar to the feeling of heroin which is which percocets are also a similar feeling to that so so don't mix it right don't have perks and sex and add something to drink you know it's like you don't know which way is up or which way is down right um and that's why like these boxers they'll like sustain they'll sustain for six weeks before the fight that just to sustain and you know to focus to so they get locked in and they they they take the that moment to come combat serious so they don't have any distractions yeah and and even with me as a christian it's like i'm i'm a new christian and i and i backslide and it's funny like the world new world thinking uses the world word karma you christian it's uh you reap what you sow right but karma is new age right that's not the way we even uh that that's not the terminology for it and it's fine god snap pet he knows what we mean but i remember these times where i was under high pressures and high tests from from god and it was like i was passing the test and i saw miracles happening just amazing things just kept on happening and i said well god i know you know the the the form of christianity we believe in we we don't believe in acts so it's some of the acts and i know it's not it's not karma so god why are all these blessings and why all these miracles happening and i had an explanation from a pastor that me and my friend chris julian had picked up hitchhiking that we um then dropped off and uh gave him some money for something like a good samaritan but when when he was talking he was talking about how he backslides but what he said is like when when your lamp is clean when your faucet is clean that god can perform miracles yeah it's like you are getting in the way of your own miracles don't be enough don't be in the way of your own miracles and every time that i pop off all that cocky stuff or we talking that money talk and all that i'm in the way of my own miracles that's why i'd like for us to be able to um to create this in a way where people saw that point there was a point that was building up but we started having these sub points to it but the point was saying that how i thought that money was going to validate me and then i got money as soon as i cried for my daughter people said you crazy and everyone felt like that was a way to down me and that to really understand that that my validation will not be from man and i'm happy that we're as we're here as brothers to be to be next to each other we brothers you know for real because we're going through a lot ridicule yeah a lot of the similar things and i'm happy to just be able to have a conversation because people will say look at this this is the first time that i'm speaking in public since south carolina right and i'm doing it here right here on your show yeah with another person who hasn't spoken since my own controversy so yeah yeah and it's and to speak if you are a public figure speaking in public is therapeutic i use the crowd uh often i use the crowd as my audience that's your therapy right and also you use it to try out some ideas right he said let me try this let me see how the crowd responds to this the reason why i know that i will eventually eventually could be three months eventually could be three and a half years ago four years so um the the reason why i eventually will make a great president is because i'm sensitive i'm here i'm i'm here to serve even as a gemini i feel the energy in the room i read body language i read this energy and i and i hurt you know the thing is this you got that spirit of discernment yeah i i hurt for the country i heard for not just black people but i heard for all all people of america and i heard from all people of the world i heard for everyone's children i heard for the situation i heard i heard for illegal aliens that that have put in their work for 20 years immigrants yeah it's like there's a nation of immigrants that uh john f kennedy wrote like that's yeah that's what this country truly is and for somebody that's that would be probably wrapping it up i would want to talk about the hurt that is going on in this country specifically and the pain that people are experiencing and i feel like that's why a lot of the frustration towards you where they might call us out of touch or crazy or coons or whatever term it is when really it comes from a place where there's a lot of pain going on yeah your music has healed so many your your words your you your outspokenness has healed so many so if they're used to yay healing how in this moment does kanye hill we're building factories we're building farms we're reinstating agriculture talk about the ecology for a minute because people like you said dr claude anderson he put us up on game he said right after the civil war during the reconstruction time where some of the best times that's when america was great uh black people were over 55 of the farmers in this country and now they're less than one percent like that agriculture is where the where the wealth truly was created for this country until this day can continue to be that and now you even stepping into that world yes and for us yeah and yeah and for us and us is you know what is beautiful about the black existence in america it is it it sharpens you just to be a black person in america like i i'm billions i remember spending uh three hours explaining what the white voice was to my to my wife because for her it's just her voice you know it's just the voice just answer the phone the same way hello but i had to explain that in order to get a job depending if you want a job downtown you had to act white and you could lose your job if you acted black but the thing is yourself you that's the thing you're not acting if you act black you're actually being yourself so your existence just to be able to pay for your well-being you literally have to act like a white person it's so funny when i go to like a wedding and it'll be a black pastor and they'll say he speaks so well he speaks so well that's that chris what what do you mean american like i like did you think he was going to talk but yeah it's like how we supposed to speak perfect like i love incorrect english my mom is an english professor i heard her use the word ain't i say don't use ain't mama she said no you could use colloquialism correct english is using the english that's appropriate to who you talking to this is from an english professor come on now so we are way simpler i play this dictionary game where we take a a pocket dictionary and all the people in the room we all get a pocket dictionary we pick a page and you highlight the words that you feel are positive and you read all the definitions now i want you to read the definition of help you think that help is a positive word right yeah the fourth definition is to avoid because you think that help is a positive word but look at how many times where uh look at this even if you meet with a an exec in la they'll not give you the deal but they'll say well how can i help you help me to like i'm gonna give you somebody else number yeah help me understand why oh yeah or how many times something didn't get fixed but a bunch of people helped yeah right the word is to ensure and a lot of the words uh ure at the end have a a a confidence in it and it uh not it's not a word i don't say confidence they have an assurance in them yeah yeah they have a future like oh i see what you're saying and and people can get to that like you can get into the it has affirmation in it negro negligent you could do words that have the because the tower of babylon has caused so much confusion that's why i love you we're trying to get to god yes and then he said boom we're going to give you all your separation yeah so when the pope talks he got to talk in 27 different languages right the the this is why i love non-verbal communication and things where you just see it because you can interpret it for whatever all this senator adams cause you asked me you know what are you doing to heal well i understand words could be healing but i'm not a professional orator i understand you know books can be healing but i'm not a professional book writer you're a professional creative you're a professor exactly i'm a producer but before i was producing things that were non-tangible music in a way you get the feeling but you can't grab it it's an invisible thing you can't eat music teach come on now you can dance for your dinner you could like music could you know it's set up thank you but it's a feeling it's a vibration it's a vibration it's a beautiful thing but i've stepped into a place of actually learning to build physical things yeah physical things building homes building domes a friend of mine said are you building single family homes i said i'm building single family don't homes bars that's how big you were in the verse so um it's that's what i'm doing i'm physically building things like the the thing about this shoe right here it was made in america and my concept is not that my concept is just local manufacturing especially we post cover we decentralize so if you buy this shoe in china it will be made in china if you buy the shoe in america it'll be made in america it's like the idea for manufacturing is the uh the mcdonald's of manufacturing and this is something that we're in stating in the gap like i love the movie the founder and i love the scene when they built the kitchen yeah that was my these are these moments i i watch the making of of movies more than the movies because i want to know how to make them right it's like when you were just talking about hey man i'm an engineer you just kept on saying how was this made because everybody can have a sketch it's another thing to materialize it you know you can ask don c he like travel and if you go to an italian uh factory they have a cup sole you put it there the reason why we up to this point we've had to always collaborate with uh organizations like nike and adidas because they're best of class at materializing this they knew the factories and the biggest fight that i had uh was to get my own factory now we have a factory in cody but this shoe is made in atlanta georgia but we have a factory in cody that can make these eva foam-injected shoes and bring jobs to america truly bringing jobs to america and truly bringing jobs to the community yeah and and redesigning communities and the thing is they don't give you that credit though yeah they want to they want to write you off when you're actually doing so much work but but i'm predicting the future i'm not a i'm not actually talking about the what we're doing right now yeah but but in that in that vibe and as as we as we wrap up you know i mean like i said if you drop so many gems it's gonna be an outstanding canons class but to to clarify and to clear up some things just based off of you running for president right now is that something that you're you're comfortable speaking about because it is it is unclear and i think that's where people could come up with these theories and what you're really trying to do because they're not clear on what your actions are i'm not running for president i'm walking so that's gonna take a little bit more time so you might not get there at 2020 would you say you're walking your way to president we'll take that i'm like spraying the ankle if i run man it's a genius ladies and gentlemen a multi genius we we patent that term and man we got three people yeah yeah yeah but i do want to give you some some content to work with on the the uh the uh running for president thing i believe that you know you jump into the deep end like i i like how trump was never governor wouldn't i'm not even going to go to people saying if he was governor he had been a better president yeah and you got you can admit that trump wasn't the greatest president though right we we know that otherwise you wouldn't be running like that that is a really no i'm i'm running because i was hit with the idea to run in 2020 right now the outcome is up to god right but if i hadn't ran for president 2024 sounds good too yeah if i hadn't ran for president i wouldn't have been in south carolina and you wouldn't have had that moment if i wasn't in south carolina god wouldn't have broke me down and had the media ridicule me in this way right and that ridicule and that being torn hit so home so close to your family yeah to be ridiculed for crying for your daughter the world needed to see me the world needed to see themselves the fact that they would do that right but also i needed to see myself right i needed to see to to to just to recalibrate you know you can you don't learn a lot you don't learn a lot from doing things perfect you learn a lot from things that could be considered a mess up or screw a mistake you say from a mistake not a hell it's a lesson it's because it's a lesson it's not ever say because god don't make mistakes i remember when i was at tmz i said you don't think i told one of my friends i said you don't think that god may have planned for me to be a tmz and his response was i'm agnostic [Laughter] good luck good luck with that that's what you tell atheists good luck because they don't they don't reply to them with the craziest atheists i mean is therapist need a therapist i mean they was pissed as asparagus [Laughter] so look man we could do this for hours because we do this like this we're just letting y'all into how how we vibe and you know a lot of people like man it was just too crazy [ __ ] talking but they might they might want a part two you know we gotta do it in a all right so cool let me get back to the gap [Laughter] but nah man i say this and with all with all seriousness you know every day i try to send you uh some scripture and i think it's like in second corinthians i believe like eight nine it talks about uh where um i think what it is it's like 12 12 8 through 9 that's corinthian second corinthians 12 8 through 9 it talks about uh we're weak for he is strong i mean that's in that yes jesus loves me song but the the part uh before that actually talks about when it says i delight in my weaknesses in the outside insults hardships and persecutions and i feel like you're an example of that of someone who you welcome all of that because you can show god's

i82trFGtY24,"[ ♪♪ ] [ ♪♪ ] >> Bob: It's like something
from a Hollywood horror movie. A hospital where patients are
given massive doses of drugs like LSD,
intensive shock therapy, put to sleep for
months at a time. >> I was reduced to a baby,
and wearing diapers and being fed and, you know... I can't imagine it. I don't remember that,
thank goodness, because it would haunt me in my dreams. >> Bob: But at Montreal's
Allan Memorial Institute, the nightmare was all too real
and incredibly what happened there was secretly supported
by the US Central Intelligence Agency and the
Canadian government. >> It just doesn't make sense
that you can take a mother away from her children and ruin her
life and that other people won't be affected too. >> Bob: I'm Bob McKeown. On this Fifth Estate,
we investigate what the Government of Canada kept
hidden for decades and what they're still trying to hide. [ ♪♪ ] [ Echoing Laughter ] [ ♪♪ ] >> Bob: It was 1964 and
five-year-old Diane McIntosh couldn't wait when her father
said they were going for a drive to visit her mother
who was in the hospital. >> My dad used to let me sit
on his knee and steer the car, and so that was play. [ ♪♪ ] >> Bob: On each visit, their car
would turn onto the long drive leading through the
hospital grounds to the Allan Memorial Institute
at McGill University in Montreal, a psychiatric facility
with the best reputation in the country. More than half a century later
Diane still remembers what she saw then as if it
were yesterday. Because when they
got to the hospital door, her enthusiasm turned to horror. >> When we got there the
place was just like a scene from 'One Flew Over The
Cuckoo's Nest' , there were people banging
their heads on the walls and droning, and my
mother was sitting there completely drugged up,
and even as a child I knew that she wasn't right. >> Bob: What they didn't know
at the time was that her mother, Helene McIntosh, and
hundreds of others like her, were unwitting guinea pigs in
brutal psychiatric experiments that took place at the
Allan Institute under the code name, MKUltra. Massive drug regimens
enforced prolonged sleep, intensive electroshock. Largely funded by the Canadian
government and the American CIA. No consent was ever
asked from the patients, and no explanation of
the experiments was ever given to them. The MKUltra brainwashing
project got its start in the early days of the
Cold War when some Canadian and American
soldiers returning from the conflict in Korea
expressed sympathy for their communist enemies. At a time of paranoia about
the so-called 'Red Menace', the Americans believed the
Soviets and Chinese might well have devised an effective
brainwashing method and the CIA was determined to crack it as
ex-CIA officer John Gittinger told the Fifth Estate in 1980. >> So we were charged with
rather an elaborate attempt to try to find out chemical,
psychological, any kind of means, that people
could use to influence the behaviour of the people. >> Bob: But the CIA knew it
could be politically difficult to fund brainwashing
directly so it set up a front company to do it,
euphemistically called The Society For The
Investigation Of Human Ecology. >> These are the days and
hours are the occasions... >> Bob: And they found a
prominent scholar doing related research in Montreal,
the renowned psychiatrist, Dr. Ewen Cameron. Co-founder of The World
Psychiatric Association, those who worked with Cameron
called him domineering and more. >> He was an authoritarian... ..ruthless, power hungry, nervous, tense, angry, man. Not very nice. >> And it is his mind, no less,
which may destroy mankind. >> Bob: Over the years,
in addition to CIA funding, Dr. Cameron received Canadian
Government research grants worth well over $4 million today for
experiments on what was called psychic driving
and de-patterning. Attempts to erase negative
memories from the human mind and replace them
with new positive ones. So it was that in 1962,
a 23-year-old mother of two, Helene McIntosh, was referred
to Ewen Cameron for what she thought would be a
time out from the pressures of motherhood and marriage. >> They promised me
that I would get rested. I was told that I would be
looked after in the hospital. >> Bob: Depressed after
the birth of her second child, her GP recommended Dr. Cameron. No one told her she would
be part of a radical science project with a full menu
of experimental treatments. Shock. Drugs like LSD. Months of induced sleep
with recordings bombarding her subconscious 24/7. After all that, Helene McIntosh
says she effectively became an infant again. >> That was hell. It really was. It's something that
you can't describe. And when I start talking
about it, I start shaking. My body shakes. It's like my body is saying,
""Don't go there."" >> Bob: Today, Helene has
only a few scattered memories of her years at the Allan. >> Electroshock and a picture
of Dr. Cameron and... But I do remember him. I remember his
voice very clearly. >> Bob: What you
remember about him? >> He sat me in front of a group
of medical students or doctors that were doing the
residency and he said, ""This woman is
hopelessly incurable."" And that was it. And he was so cold. >> Bob: But through all
of that, her young daughter, Diane, raised by grandparents,
lived for those special times when her mother got the
chance to spend a few hours with her girls. [ ♪♪ ] >> I remember when she was
able to come out for a visit and she would be able to
come over and tuck me in at my granny's place and
I would just lie there... immobile after she left and
when granny would come in to say goodnight, I'd say,
""Don't touch the covers, ""don't touch the covers,
don't change it because mum left ""it this way"", and I tried
to sleep all night without moving the--
moving the covers. [ ♪♪ ] >> Bob: In all,
Helene McIntosh spent two years at the
Allan Institute. Most of her memories erased
like data on a hard drive. [ ♪♪ ] >> That's you. >> Yeah. Look how dark my hair is. I don't think that's-- >> Bob: Today, at home
in British Columbia, much of the McIntosh family
album is a mystery to Helene. Now it's Diane who must guide
her mom through the images of the past she no
longer remembers. >> There is Carolynn. So they're not in order.
>> No, that is me. >> That's you. Of course. >> Bob: It is clear
that in different ways, both McIntoshs are victims of
that secret brainwashing project in Montreal and they
are far from alone. [ ♪♪ ] >> Bob: Hundreds of victims
passed through these doors in the 1950s and '60s. All with her own horror stories. >> I feel like I've
been completely used. I feel like my mind has
been completed invaded. >> I had to be toilet trained. I was a vegetable. I had no identity,
I had no memory, I had never existed
in the world before, just like a baby. >> I suffered. I suffered like hell. >> My mother had to
stay with me all the time. She couldn't leave me one hour. >> Bob: Five decades later,
the Government Of Canada has been more deeply
involved in all this than it wants to admit,
with new secret settlements, shutting down lawsuits
and gag orders, and as you will
see after the break, it is not something they
want you to know about. >> The government
doesn't seem to do anything. They don't recognize you. It's wrong.
It's shameful. [ ♪♪ ] >> The story doesn't end here. Like the Fifth Estate's
Facebook page so you can follow our investigations. We will post updates
on stories and special video features that
take you deep inside. [ ♪♪ ] [ ♪♪ ] >> Bob: From 1950
until the mid-60s, Montreal's respected
psychiatric facility, the Allan Memorial Institute,
was the site of secret brainwashing experiments
funded by the CIA under the code-name MKUltra,
with money from the Canadian government as well. The program would quietly
be shut down in 1965. [ ♪♪ ] >> Bob: But the truth about
what happened there would be protected for another
decade and a half longer. Then, in 1980, we were among
the first to tell Canadians about it. >> The Fifth Estate.
>> I'm Adrienne Clarkson. Tonight, we report on a secret
CIA research project carried out in Montreal in which mental
patients felt they were used as the CIA's guinea pigs. >> They kept you asleep for 23
days and while I was asleep, they were shocking the heck
out of me with electric shocks. >> Bob: And the Fifth Estate
stayed on the story for years to come. From then, to now,
many of the key questions have remained the same. >> The Fifth Estate. >> So why was Ottawa so
ambiguous when it came to helping some Canadian citizens
get compensation from Washington for what they endured in a
program that was inspired mostly by American Cold War fears? Well, the answer was simple. The Government Of Canada was
even more deeply involved in the Allan Memorial experiments
than the Americans. [ ♪♪ ] >> Get away.
>> Calm down. >> No, get off. Hey! >> Hold him! >> Bob: After word of
the experiments at the Allan Memorial Institute
came out, the CBC broadcast a drama entitled
'The Sleep Room' about Dr Ewen Cameron's
mind control treatments. In the absence of visual
evidence inside the hospital, it is as close as we can come
to how it looked and sounded. [ ♪♪ ] >> Natalie. [ Screaming ] >> Driving doesn't work. Can you admit that now? We destroyed these
people for nothing! You can't just walk away
from this, Cameron! It'll come back
and it will ruin you! >> Many of them were just
sitting there like zombies and I have a headache. I don't remember anything. >> Bob: Gina Blasbalg was 15
and in an orphanage when she was sent to the Allan. She got massive drug doses
and was kept asleep for months, fortunately she never
received electroshock therapy, which may explain why she
remembers the real Dr Cameron and his patients. How did those patients regard,
or apparently regard, Dr Cameron? >> Those patients
were too far gone. The ones that were not too
far gone where terrified of him. We were all terrified
to see him around. We didn't want to be near him. I don't think that any
patient ever wanted to be close to Dr Cameron. >> Bob: When news of Cameron's
experiments was revealed, nine of the Canadian victims
filed a lawsuit against the Central Intelligence Agency
alleging they had been unwittingly used in research
that was medically improper, even illegal. Plaintiff, Velma Orlikow,
of Winnipeg, didn't think they
stood a chance. >> I've often when I
have been alone at home, thought, how can
you fight the CIA? Who in the heck do
you think you are? How can you fight the CIA? >> Bob: But eventually
in the late '80s, David got a
concession from Goliath. The CIA settled with the
Canadian patients for about $90,000 apiece. A moral victory, at least. And a few years after
that, in the '90s, the Government Of Canada
announced its own compensation plan but only for the most
seriously injured victims. Those who survived
the experiments in a childlike state. The government also
insisted it had no legal or moral obligations to do it. To many, that system
seemed designed not to distribute compensation,
but to discourage it. In the end, only 80 of the
patients subjected to the brutal psychiatric
experiments were approved for federal compensation. Another 250 were denied and who
knows how many more never even knew the compensation
program existed? So when the application
deadline came and went, and it was too late to apply,
the government's secret brainwashing program
simply faded into the past. Or did it? [ ♪♪ ] >> Bob: The government deadline
expired 23 years ago and the majority of survivors
had already passed away. When a few weeks back,
CBC News reporter, Elizabeth Thompson,
was pouring over government financial records. Buried deep within those 2017
public accounts was an item about a mysterious payment
linked to those brainwashing experiments years ago. >> It talked about, you know,
compensation for someone who had been depatterned at
the Allan Memorial Institute. >> Bob: 'Name Withheld' it said. No other information about
the victim was available. But with some digging,
Elizabeth Thompson would learn the Trudeau
government had prevented the victim's family
from ever discussing the settlement. Thompson discovered the
'Name Withheld' was that of Allison Steel. She's the daughter
of Jean Steel, who arrived at the
Allan Institute in 1957 with a severe case of
postpartum depression. Today, Allison Steel sill
can't discuss the settlement, but she can talk
about her mother. She says she effectively was
raised without a mom after Jean became a Cameron patient
and the years of drugs, sleep therapy, and electroshock. >> It's erasing your memory. I mean, how dare they do
that to a human being? How dare they do
that to a human being? >> Bob: According to Allison,
the result was that when Jean eventually returned home,
behind her lovely smile, she was intellectually
and emotionally absent. Her marriage and
family relationships irretrievably broken. Allison's family had been
trying to get compensation, and failing, for decades. In 1993, Allison's father's
application was officially denied in writing after the
government wouldn't give him the hospital records he
needed to prove his wife had been medically tortured. >> I have a big thick file of
all his handwritten letters back and forth to
the government... declaring, stating all of the
treatments that, you know, all the things that
had happened to her. But we didn't
have the main file. >> Bob: And then
the years went by. First, Allison's mother,
Jean, died and her father passed away at 93. His quest to have the federal
government do what's right for victims like Jean,
still unfulfilled. But two years ago,
a breakthrough. Allison made an official
request for her mother's full medical file under the
Access To Information Act. And this time, incredibly,
a package arrived in the mail. >> So I waited and sure
enough about a month later, I received a manila
envelope with about 300 pages, legal sized, double sided,
of all the bedside notes. >> Bob: In the basement
chest in Knowlton, Quebec where she stores those records,
is a mine of information that the government had
kept to itself for decades. Notes her father could have
used years ago to prove what happened to her mother. Among those
newly-discovered notes, some written by
Ewen Cameron himself, Allison's mother, Jean,
is described as 'overactive', 'overtalkative', 'distractable',
'very suspicious', showing 'inappropriate
behaviour' and 'crying for no reason.' Those adjectives certainly
could describe someone no longer mature
enough to be a mother because of Dr Cameron's
de-patterning. And other notes from Cameron
and colleagues clearly state that Jean Steel had
at least 24 intensive electroshock sessions
and might require weekly shock treatments for the
next two to five years, seemingly indicating
a very serious condition. >> Now, these are the
files your Dad never saw. >> He never saw those files. >> Bob: Your father never
got that kind of material? >> No, he didn't. Well, I guess it was his word
against the government's word. >> Bob: How do you think he
would feel about you and this? >> Oh, he would
be proud as punch. He would be
proud as punch of me. I know he would. Oh, yeah. He would be very happy. >> Bob: When Allison Steel took
those new medical documents to her lawyer, Alan Stein,
he immediately launched a court action against the
federal government. He says the Steel family
finally had the proof they'd always needed. >> There is no
question about it. The medical, or medical
history and medical report confirms this. >> Bob: You talk
to Allison, she says, ""That took my mother away."" She had no capacity to be
a mature parent after that. >> That's right.
And I've seen that. I've seen medical reports
from many, many other former patients of Dr Cameron
who were denied compensation and the same thing
happened to them. >> Bob: And ultimately,
the federal government would agree to pay compensation
in her mother's name on the condition neither she
nor her lawyer ever talk about it in public. What does that tell us about
the mindset of the current government that this should
be something they insist upon? >> Because they don't
want more applications. They don't want to have to
deal with more applications. If this went to court, it would
have more publicity and more applications would
be forthcoming. >> Bob: Now in
accepting your settlement, you were required to have
a nondisclosure agreement. >> Correct. >> Bob: You couldn't talk
about the settlement itself. >> No. >> Bob: Let me ask you
about what that represents. Is that not apparently a way
for the government to limit the number of people
who learn about this, who might be entitled to
something like this themselves? >> Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm. Well, it seems to be
something because... >> Bob: Yeah. Why else would they do it? >> Why they are
still covering up? Why are they
still covering it up? Maybe they won't
if they hear about this. You know, maybe they will try to
realize and recognize what the government did before and may
be there's still hope that they could at least
recognize these victims. >> Bob: And lawyer, Alan Stein,
says it is now time for the Government Of Canada to
finally admit the role it played in those brutal experiments. >> The government
never admitted, acknowledged that it was
responsible for the experiments carried out by Dr Cameron
and which experiments the Government Of Canada funded. There was no question that
the Government Of Canada funded these experiments. >> Bob: Do you believe that
responsibility should be taken? >> I definitely believe it. >> Bob: The years of
silence haven't been easy for the victims. For survivor, Helene McIntosh,
and her oldest daughter, Diane, it's taken years to
be able to discuss it all with one another. Diane was only three
when her mother entered the Allan Institute. And Helene knows too well that
Diane and the other girls have been profoundly affected
by what happened to her. >> I just hope that she--
I know she's forgiven me for-- I don't think she's ever
held it against me. When she was on
the phone, all she said was, I love you so much. I love you so much. And I know she does, you know? >> I'm still dealing with this. So I'm still struggling with it. There... There have been negative
ramifications in my life that have prevented me from being
happy and from being productive at many times. [ ♪♪ ] >> Bob: Helene McIntosh was one
of the lucky ones who got a hard fought settlement from
the government in the 1990s. But she says for her, it was
about a lot more than that. >> I got the compensation. But for me, it wasn't the money. It was the... validation that I received. That I wasn't totally crazy. You know? That I was treated the way I was
and it made me do crazy things but I didn't go in there crazy. [ ♪♪ ] >> Not having our mom was
not great but if you remind her of that, there's-- it hurts her
too much, you know? I just have to say,
""It wasn't you. ""It was them."" >> Bob: It is now the better
part of seven decades since the Allan Memorial Institute in
Montreal became that house of horrors. Today, perhaps hundreds
of Canadians, survivors and family members,
are still paying the price for the brainwashing experiments
sponsored by the Canadian and American governments. Yet to this day, neither the
US nor Canada has ever said, ""We're sorry."" [ ♪♪ ] ",3

Ewen Cameron world-renowned chairman of the department of psychiatry at McGill and director of the Allen memorial Institute the CIA secretly funded the medical experiments through a front in New York City called of all things the Society for the protection of human ecology documents show that the agency had been impressed with earlier work done at McGill in sensory deprivation work that was useful in designing sophisticated torture techniques later on but at the time brainwashing looked even more promising and dr. Cameron was the perfect one to carry out the work an American citizen with a world-class reputation operating outside of the United States dr. Cameron certainly had the credentials at various times president of the Canadian the American and even the world psychiatric association in an address to colleagues from around the world Cameron showed that he certainly knew the potential of the human mind for good and bad though all echo came to the Allan for her postpartum depression everybody in the hospital was very much in awe of dr. Cameron and he strode the halls like a giant and people would say oh they're but for God goes God and to me I thought how could he possibly ever take me for a patient Who am I I'm being this great man who's done all these marvelous things and boy I better work hard and I better do everything that he tells me to do and you know I don't want to lose this opportunity to get well like mrs.

Cameron it was a very very impressive man and I was told it was the best doctor in averag North America I saw him he would look at you a few minutes ask you a few questions and then proceed with the treatments but I never saw him once in all the times that I saw him that I wasn't afraid every time I went down to his office I would shake with fear and every time I'd see him coming down the hall I'd shake with fear but I adored him dr. Elliott Emmanuel knew Cameron he was an authoritarian ruthless power-hungry nervous tense angry man not really nice at Raven's Cregg dr. Cameron went further with drugs and electric shock treatments than any of the US researchers in the MKULTRA project dared his aim was to wipe the mind clean then he would implant new messages by forcing the patient to listen to a hypnotic repetition as many as a quarter of a million times this was called psychic driving most of the drugs used in the program were experimental and some dangerous there was the tranquilizer Arte a paralysis inducing and neck tee and curare which pygmies tip their arrows with to paralyze victims Alba captain another experimental tranquilizer and lysergic acid diethylamide the Hallucigenia a in her room at Raven's Craig misses Orlick Oh waited for her first treatment hypodermic with a needle syringe and the card on it had my name so I looked a little more closely and it was lysergic acid diethylamide and my husband was a druggist and I knew a lot of drugs but I'd never heard of that one and so I phoned a friend and who was a psychiatric nurse and I said do you know what it is and she said I never heard of it but she had a friend who was a psychiatrist so she phoned her friend and she called me back and she said he said that this stuff causes poisonous psychosis she said he just said not to take it well I thought you know he's a very Freudian psychiatrist and doesn't believe in any medication of any kind and after all here's dr. Cameron I mean he's the big doctor and he's you know he's known all over the world and he wouldn't do anything that would harm me etc and so I took the injection and I didn't like it and it really did create a poisonous psychosis LSD with all its frightening mental images was scarcely known at the time but the CIA secretly brought some in from Switzerland where it had just been developed the room became very distorted and I thought my bones were all melting and I just wanted to scream that I wanted to get out of there and I saw the squirrels outside and I thought they're not the squirrels I'm the squirrel I'm in this cage and I can't get out and I started to throw myself from side to side in the room and I couldn't right they had given me a pen some paper and asked me to write down but I couldn't write I couldn't do anything I couldn't focus I couldn't I don't know it was like some kind of funny hail I'd fallen into and I couldn't get out and I don't know how long that went on it was just a terrible nightmare and I just felt that my life was threatened I could never go back to what I'd been Robert loggia Vancouver was 18 when he came to the Allen complaining of trembling and severe leg pains diagnosed as psychosomatic like mrs. Orlick oh and mrs. who are he had no inkling he was to be part of a CIA experiment LSD was very horrifying and they gave it to me for about 12 or 15 times one minute I would see the doctor there and explained I wouldn't see him there and they were asking me all kinds of questions and I remember them telling me that I was getting smaller and smaller and I really felt myself getting smaller and they were bringing me back in time way back and you know at one point I almost felt like it was just about to be born really that far back in memory and they're really really probing and asking all kinds of questions and I felt I didn't have any control I had to answer I didn't feel I had any control I was completely like they had complete control over me mrs. Hugh art like the others was forced to pay for the so-called treatment massive electric shocks and all the drugs they would give me as much as 40 pills a day and I would ask the nurse what is that they would say it's a new drug and they only named it by a number almost drugs do to you how did they know I was I was very very strong well powered so these drugs kind of desensitize me they would put my my reactions they would lower my resistance as well as the experimental drugs and massive electric shock treatments missus who art was subjected to psychic driving hypnotic like messages were repeated over and over to a sleeping patient sometimes for as long as 16 hours in a row they were a key part of the mind-control experiment this is how missus who art remembers one of the messages I would try very strongly not to be not to let my mind be capting all the messages but they would lower my resistance so much with the average rugs but I could I couldn't do otherwise then listen did you ever ask them how any of this was making you better no I didn't ask question I was just saying I don't want to go through it again and I would cry I didn't want you know I knew you way down in my heart I knew it wasn't good but you know how could you fight you're in a hospital where it's supposed to be the best with the best doctors so what can you do I'd say I can't I can't take it anymore I can't stand it I don't think this is doing me any good I feel worse and he'd walked down the hall a little way with me and put his arm on my shoulder and come on now lassie you know you're going to do it and finally I'd say well okay and off we'd go to my room and he would give me another injection and then pat me on the shoulder and off he'd be again I had LSD I believe a total of 14 times and sometimes there would be four days between the injections and sometimes there would be one consecutive day after the other and some of them I managed to write down things in my notes to talk to Cameron a newly declassified CIA document shows there was at least one voice of protest at the agency as the experiments got underway one agent wrote does Project Officer approve these immoral and inhuman tests I suggest that all who are in favor of the above intended operation volunteered their heads for use in dr. so-and-so's noble project the names were deleted in her hospital room a terrified mrs. Allah Co tried to hide like a child at the sound of dr. Cameron's approaching footsteps sit on the toilet and nobody will see me anyhow that didn't work because he knocked on the door and he said now come on Lassie you know you're in there and come on you come out and let me give your injection and I said no I'm not taking any more injections I can't do it I don't care if I die I can't I can't do it anymore because this is killing me and that's all there is to it I can't do it well he wasn't very happy about it and however after a little discussion he turned on his heel and left the room the electric shock treatments were administered on an unprecedented scale it was called deep patterning the mind was short-circuited so the psychic driving hypnotic messages could be planted on a clean slate there is now no known use of electric shocks on such a scale even in Soviet mental asylums where political crimes are punished psychiatrist and former colleague of dr.

Elliot Emmanuel as you probably know electroshock treatment has been given for depression for something like 40 years now it's a very successful and useful treatment for severe depression that doesn't respond to other things but deep patterning is a use of electroshock treatment in totally different way in which instead of giving the shocks say two or three times a week they're given two or three times a day for three or four weeks reducing the patient to a sort of animal vegetable state from which it's hoped that they would recover in a more healthy state of mind it didn't work I was there for a while I thought I don't want to stay here started to run away from the hospital and they grabbed me and then they put me on sleep treatment and now they kept you asleep for 23 days and while I was asleep they were shocking the heck out of me with electric shocks and playing tapes there was another lady who had same kind of psychic driving that I did and she was a very wiry slender lady and with lots of pep and zip you know and she'd go to the dances and this and that and one day she just wasn't there and when we asked where she went they said oh well you know she's gone to another hospital well sometime later I was in the day hospital and I happened to ask a nurse if she'd heard what had happened to this lady and she said oh that's her sitting over there and I looked and there was a fat lady that just looked like she was made out of dough she didn't know me she didn't know herself she didn't know anybody she was gone now that's a death did you ever try and get away from there did you ever say I'm just not going back I tried I was home for the weekend and I had a pass for the weekend that's how they call it so when I was there I said I'm not going back there so I telephoned or somebody else in the house telephone and they said if you're not coming back we're sending the police after you so I remember being so upset I was crying I didn't want to go in and it was really like a concentration camp [Music] there was a gentleman who jumped off the roof of the Allen I don't think he had LSD but he had sleep therapy with with psychic driving you know with the driving tapes under his pillow and they told him he was going to go home and he just come out of sleep therapy and he just jumped he said when around big smile on his face said goodbye to everybody and up on the roof and jumped off and landed at the back door of the atma which was the dreadful awful thing I don't think he was more than 30 and he was just gone just gone and there was this big wash to her yet the back door nobody would go in and out of that back door for a long time and everybody in the huh and the hospital spoke in hushed tones and everybody was affected they would not talk about it it was the silic did not happen in 1973 all MK ULTRA files under the control of the technical services division chief of the CIA were ordered destroyed by the director Richard Helms but in a bureaucracy as vast as the Central Intelligence Agency it's difficult to destroy everything and the damning evidence of the Cameron project surfaced after a Freedom of Information Act suit it revealed mrs. Orly Co had reason for her nightmares and her doubts I've heard that it was the most brutal program under that under MKULTRA in the States and in Canada that this was the most brutal it was an awful feeling to realize when I found this out that the man whom I had thought cared about what happened to me didn't give a damn I was a fly just to fly her husband David Orlick Oh NDP Member of Parliament for 22 years remembers the cost we had Blue Cross coverage but we didn't have but Blue Cross did not cover treatment in a mental hospital so what we did that after the first year was to sell the house which was really the only money that we had and my daughter and I moved in with the house mother and we stayed there almost three years it was it was tough but the financial cost was really a small part of the cost to be talking about cost it really it really disrupted our lives mrs. Orlick Oh sued the our Memorial Institute and last year it quietly settled out of court for $50,000 but that's only the amount she estimates she had to pay for what she thought was treatment apart from giving mrs. Orlick Oh her money back the alum has done nothing to compensate Cameron's other victims but in the u.s. a former CIA director Stansfield Turner promised the Congress the agency would try and track down victims of the MKULTRA project in both Canada and the US so they might get compensation the CIA wrote the Allan this recently Declassified letter addressed to Maurice Don J then director it said it has been our understanding that there are no remaining records of dr. Cameron's research that might reveal the identities of patients under his care during the time period in question however by way of leaving no stone unturned we now inquire whether this information might be reconstituted through patient records financial records or other hospital records Sincerely Yours Daniel B silver General Counsel CIA so even the CIA made some effort to find the victims but little help from Montreal there is no record of the Allen ever attempting a search of all its medical records although Cameron's successor admits it would be easy enough to do CIA documents show that 53 people in Montreal were subjected to the kay ultra experiments but only nine of those have been positively identified apart from Orlick ohyou art and Logie there were three Montreal housewives one of whom is now institutionalized there's a Montreal businessman who never really got his life together again after the experiments and another man who has been destitute for most of the time since ironically enough one of the victims is now a psychiatrist practicing in Eastern Ontario she obviously functions well enough but after the experiments ten years of her memory was wiped right out the McGill project was abruptly terminated in 1964 and so dr. Cameron returned to the United States three years later he died suddenly of a heart attack subsequent evaluation of Cameron's work in Montreal by his successor showed that the intensive shock therapy was not only medically useless but potentially dangerous Cameron though never revealed how much he knew about the CIA sponsorship of his work Robert Logie was later given cortisone treatment for the pains in his leg that brought him to the Allen in the first place it worked but his mind is a different story he now has joined with mrs. Orlick Oh madam cured and six other Canadians in a massive lawsuit against the United States government they contend that they sought treatment and instead were made unwitting victims of CIA experiments the nine Canadians are seeking 1 million dollars apiece in damages from the US government the CIA intimidates many American law firms but this case is being fought by a lawyer who defended Lillian Hellman and Arthur Miller during the McCarthy witch hunts for communists in preparation the lawyers have interrogated every CIA agent involved in MKULTRA including former director Helms with the trial expected to start soon Joseph raw sums up the case with his junior partner James Turner John get injure is the former CIA staff agent who testified at his request the CIA contacted Cameron and informed him that up front and New York would support his work as a result of that Cameron received CIA funds to finance the LSD and brainwashing --tx but other ways camera on all he did was what the CIA was in effect asking him to do and what he said he was going to do and he did it and they I paid him money for it and then what about Godley now we got a lot of stuff out of a godly here's one of his depositions we got him I take it he said I'm gonna wash my hands of this I'm approved the project but I don't have to take care of the Canadian citizens are gonna be affected is that fair that's very admitted that they took no steps whatsoever to guarantee that people wouldn't be injured if it could be avoided or to make sure that people even knew that they were participating in an experiment well this guy Godley he's got quite a record of the on negligent action ahead of time I mean before this ever he was personally involved in an experiment that resulted in the death of a US Army is that the one where they put the LSD and the cuatro of a guy named Olsen yeah and then he jumped out of a window and committed suicide in New York City they managed to cover that up too I like a man who his general counsel CIA his name's Larry Huston and at that time he said this was culpable negligence he was a general counsel and they went on left a guy on the job who had been guilty according to their own lawyer of culpable night what about Helms we took his deposition bill is right here yeah it's an awful thick deposition he didn't remember a whole lot there's a major case of forget me it's the only thing that he we really got out of him was that he instructed Gottlieb the CIA's dr. Gottlieb to destroy the records when the story broke about the covert CIA activities on Canadian soil the United States sent a formal apology to the Trudeau government but External Affairs Minister Allen McKagan has refused to release that document to mrs. Orlick oh and the others in the lawsuit this Declassified State Department letter shows why address to the Canadian embassy it reads this is with reference to your request for the views of the US intelligence community concerning possible release by the Canadian government of certain documents relating to the oil echo matter your request was given careful review on the basis of which it has been requested that the Canadian government withhold from disclosure the documents in question we've moved heaven and earth to get the correspondence and the documents of the discussions between the Canadian government and the United States the United States won't give it to us because they're covering up they're wrong the Canadian government won't give it to us because they're scared of the United States government both of them are holding back all of the information about this I think the case could be broken if the Canadian government would say to the CIA we're not gonna cover up for you any longer we're gonna allow then we're gonna give this material to mr. Arley Co for his case well if the Canadian government has this apology from the US why in the world do you think they wouldn't release it oh I just think the Canadian government's a little bit like international wimps in the case of the United States I don't know why they're so scared of us we're not gonna do anything I don't think the Seventh Army is gonna attack Montreal because you give us that material I understand though that the the American position is that this kind of CIA material can't be released for national security reasons maybe that's true well security my neck French the CIA the that everything they forget then when they have to stop forgetting because it's ludicrous then they say it's all national security what is national security about the apologies of the United States to Canada they get very belligerent Canadians with the Russians when I shoot down the double-oh-seven with some Canadian citizens but when the CIA covertly does something to all the citizen ruin the lives of many of these citizens while the Canadian governments do it nothing I don't know why Canada made forceful representations on behalf of the Toronto businessman who was kidnapped by bounty hunters taken back to Florida that wouldn't indicate that they're afraid to make a ruckus downtown that was a pretty easy situation I mean my god you kidnap a Canadian I'd take him to the United States heavens above and furthermore you who do you have to fight they're a couple of bounty hunters here you're fighting a CIA that scares the Canada I'm surprised that if your case is as strong as you say that the American government isn't trying to get an out-of-court settlement pay out a bunch of money and just hope it'll go away when the CIA went into this brainwashing stuff what they call the MKULTRA program when they went into that they injured lots more people than the nine we are suing for they injured a great many other here and here in the United Stated states they may feel that they've got so many skeletons in their closet that's settling with us even though we're clearly right and they would like it to go away would hurt them as a precedent I can't think of any other reason that they're being so really rough on us I think there is a duty on the government to to release in a matter such as this all of the information it has ala Lawrence is the conservative justice critic in the Commons it's been government complicity or government negligence so be it you know it's far better to make a full disclosure and and and a full confession of your sins in a matter such as this it's always a difficult thing for anybody to sue a government or sue an agency in the government and if you don't have the cooperation of your own government in doing that a few strikes against you right off the bat if the process was reversed it was some sort of a secretive Canadian operation taking place in the United States I'm sure all hell would break loose down there as far as beating of breasts and waving of flags and whatnot if the material came from the states perhaps they're bound by if not law good manners to not turn it over if the source of the information doesn't want it turned over I don't know about manners I don't know about international matters very much but I know this if I were in charge of a government to whom nine citizens that we are suing for have been brainwashed without their knowing have had their lives in pain and have it done by a foreign agency undercover without the Government of Canada knowing it I would find a way to help those people instead of hindering them we tried to ask External Affairs Minister McKellen why the Government of Canada is not helping these Canadian citizens who were victimized by agents of another country but for more than two months mr. McCracken has been unavailable to discuss the matters what do you want to tell mr. McKevitt for example about what happened to you how you feel about it now I would tell him to try what we've been through and see what he would have to say after because only when you go through such an experience one can say how bad it can be and hope thankful I'd say come on get off your horse and help us we need some help from our government we are innocent victims of something that happened that should never have been and you can't make it you can't put us back where we were but at least do something to help us now do something to stand up and say this can't happen in Canada what can you possibly get for your clients out of this case you can't get their health back that's not possible and there are older people and some of them may die during this stonewalling by the CIA and some of them may get worse one of them at least is in an institution now I mean the thing is very much needed needing of speed by the to get regular you can get some money that's all you can get so you can get it when a doctor a miss operates on you know you don't get your health back there's no way we'd get our hell of their health back but what we can get them is some funds to help ameliorate their old age with the damage that's been done to them by this lousy performance and occurred through the CIA by camera on mistreating him and hurting them one thing which triggered mrs. who are initial depression was growing deafness in one year that was later corrected with minor surgery but no surgery can undo dr. Cameron's work at Raven's Craig I cannot go to sleep without any medication I have migraine headaches that last for a week at the time doctors cannot find a cause I have slight amnesia I have a lot of trouble to concentrate I've never been able to sleep without medication since to sleep freely I went through years and years and years of severe depressions I dream about it I all my all my waking hours to think about it it's like it's eating me up I've been hospitalized when I first went home to Winnipeg I attempted to take my own life because I couldn't enjoy the way I felt and I have a a chronic need I'm very dependent on other people and I have a chronic depression which at times gets worse not being with my family not being able to follow a career not being able to study anymore which I wanted to do very much I would say it cost me my life you ",3
N1plntUzGuA,"If it’s Thursday, old conspiracy theories
gain new steam. President Trump tweeting another conspiracy theory. Baseless allegation that former President
Obama wiretapped him during a 2016 campaign. Once in the margins of politics, today, conspiracy
theories are headline news. Clinton has Parkinson’s Disease, Clinton
has ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. If the Russians are attacking our election in order to elect Trump, they’re not going to do that for free. A conspiracy theory can spread faster 
than it ever could before, because it goes like a flash on social media. With 9/11, the whole thing is a black hole of lies. Some conspiracy theories have become part
of our national psyche. More and more Americans, according to the
polls, have become convinced they haven’t been told the whole truth about the Kennedy
assassination. There’s nothing quite like the Kennedy assassination,
I think, in the realm of conspiracy theory. What can this seminal moment in American history
tell us about the grip of the new breed of conspiracy theories 
we’re seeing today? From Dallas, Texas, the flash apparently official: President Kennedy died at 1 p.m. Central Standard Time, 2:00 Eastern Standard Time, some 38 minutes ago. The conspiracy theories - they actually began
exploding almost from the moment it was officially announced that the president was dead. All kinds of rumors were spreading that the Soviets might have done it, the Cubans might have done it. It was the anti-Castro Cubans. 
It was the FBI, it was the Mafia. Bobby Kennedy will ask the head of the CIA, 
“Did you kill my brother?” In other words, 
a coup d’etat as opposed to a lone gunman. Almost every aspect of the assassination 
was under dispute. From where the gunshots came from,
 to the number of shooters involved. I definitely saw the man shooting from the knoll. It was on the 6th floor. My book shows quite conclusively that shots came from at least two directions. The JFK conspiracy theories arose 
out of a spectacular crime that occurred under very suspicious circumstances. Jefferson Morley has been studying the Kennedy
assassination for 30 years. He says the questions mounted when the main suspect, Lee Harvey Oswald, was killed in custody. And the concerns escalated when the government
released the findings of its official investigation. Today, the Warren Report attempts to unravel the dark twists into which the national tragedy was thrown. So the Warren Commission investigated and then they put out this report, not a particularly
convincing account of the crime. They’ve sealed away some of the evidence and I think that’s rather disturbing to most people. Why did Oswald do this? The Warren Commission never came up with a motive. Why would he do it? People said, ""No, the government’s explanation 
doesn’t make sense,"" and they began to look for other ways to explain it and so they came up with conspiracy theories. For many, the proof of conspiracy was confirmed when they saw an amateur home movie taken
by a Dallas businessman. The most dramatic and most important single
piece of evidence of the assassination was provided by Mr. Abraham Zapruder on one roll
of 8 mm color film, Mr. Zapruder had the astonishing luck to capture the entire assassination. When people saw the film – and anyone who sees the film I think can agree, that when you first see it, it looks like the president must have been shot in the front of the head
because his head is thrown violently backwards. The Warren Commission said the president was
hit in the rear of the head. That basic conflict led people to assume that there was a second
shooter, evidence of a conspiracy that has been covered up by the government. And that
really is the main gist of an argument that has now been going on for more than 50 years. The film was studied frame-by-frame, used as a critical piece of evidence for those challenging the official line that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. As the conspiracy theories began to take hold, the CIA issued a memo expressing concern,
saying, “innuendo of such seriousness affects […] the whole reputation of the American government.” A memo lays out the strategy for the CIA to marginalize and discredit critics of the Warren Commission and he explains how you should do it. Secretly, you should cultivate your contacts in the newspapers, you should make “X”, “Y”, and “Z” arguments about why conspiracy is ridiculous. But the public wasn’t buying it, and by the mid 1970’s, the lasting narrative had been set. The CBS News nationwide poll last month indicated
that in President Kennedy’s case, 68% believe that Oswald 
was involved with others in the crime. I remind you that the official version is, Oswald alone was solely responsible. Only 15% believe that. As the years have gone by, I’ve come to
understand that people ache for an explanation of the unexplainable. They ache for an explanation
that’s broader, more - darker if you will than what the facts dictate the story actually is. And throughout history, conspiracy thinking
has been part of the American fabric. You can go back a couple hundred years and then you will see, “Oh, we’re afraid of the Red Coats."" And in the 1990s they’re afraid of the black helicopters. There’s always someone coming for us. You know I love great conspiracy theories,
and these are better than a lot of them. Because they say ""Why is the flag rippling? 
There is no air."" We have been conditioned 
to believe conspiracy theories. Hollywood movies, television shows, but also the federal government. The federal government kept millions of documents secret. Whether
it’s looking at Vietnam, looking at the last Iraqi war, Watergate, and you say to yourself,
""The federal government is not telling us everything."" Our government, every year, 
declares 16 million things top secret, 16 million. I would say that’s about everything. But at the same time, exploding sources of
information have left the public confused about the line between fact and fiction. At the time of the Kennedy assassination, there were a few places in the country which overwhelmingly, people in the country trusted as honest brokers of information. There’s no authority anymore. Nobody’s going to take CBS or the New York Times word for it. You don’t have a common reality, and so people can generate their own facts. This is a breeding ground for conspiracy theories. Pizzagate is real, the question is how real
is it. What is it? Something’s going on. Something’s being covered up. 
It needs to be investigated. Toward the end of 2016, conspiracy theorists
honed in on leaked Clinton campaign emails that referred to a Washington, DC pizza joint. I got a call from a reporter with the Washington City Paper, asking if I had heard about this kind of bubbling conspiracy theory 
that was on chat rooms. The online chatter focused on words in the emails, like pizza and cheese, and claimed they were actually code for a child sex ring run by top-ranking Democrats, and headquartered
at James Alefantis’s restaurant. There was like hundreds of lines of chat about
a human trafficking scheme involving Hillary Clinton that focused around Comet Pizza. You’ve got to see their menus. Notice the symbol of the ping pong paddles and it’s clever resemblance to the FBI document’s symbol for child love. It’s a bubbling noise. But then once this bubbling noise becomes broadcast on a megaphone to millions and millions of viewers, it really becomes a dangerous situation. An alarming and bizarre incident in the nation’s capital after a man opened fire at a popular pizzeria. Court documents say Welch read online that
the Comet restaurant was harboring child sex slaves. It was completely surreal, I mean,
I’m so thankful that no one was hurt. The story of Comet Pizza can only be described as an outlandish theory. There are no facts. There is absolutely no evidence. There’s no photographic evidence. There’s no written evidence. There’s no evidence. And yet it won’t go away. I do not stand behind James
Alefantis and Comet Ping Pong. Months after the theory was debunked by authorities,
protests drew people from all over the country who believe the government is involved in
the trafficking of children. To think we could stumble upon a ring like
that in Washington, DC, is very plausible. Not even an apology by Alex Jones, the so-called “king of conspiracy,” has changed the minds of true believers. It’s very difficult to dissuade people 
from their cherished beliefs. And they’ll just pick out the pieces of evidence that seem to support it, but then forget everything else that would not support it. One reason conspiracy theories catch on, according to historians, is that something larger is at play. Americans do not trust their leaders. I think
that Americans do not trust the basic institutions that govern us, whether they’re corporations,
universities, the judiciary. And that trust has been eroding for decades.
In 1964, when the Warren Report was released, 77% of Americans said they trusted
the government to do what’s right. Today, that number has plummeted to under 12%. If you don’t believe that these authorities
have your best interest at heart, if you can’t believe that these authorities are telling
you the truth, you’re still searching for answers. And what you then turn to is these counter-authorities, these conspiracy theorists who say, “I’ve
got the answers.” And with politics becoming increasingly polarized,
peddling in conspiracy has become the new normal. We’ve moved fairly quickly, fairly deeply into a post truth, post-fact era. That is, an era where any number of people, including some of them in the highest reaches of our
own government can say “Well, facts are fungible.” The challenge for the truth is, you know,
even greater than it ever has been. A lot of people have come out and said I am correct. Yeah, but the data has to show 
that three million illegals voted. Forget that, forget all of that. This president who has become an opinion-maker
supreme to at least 40% of the American people is shaping a vision that I think is going
to take us decades to remove and if his style continues as such, we are going to have a
great deal of difficulty rooting conspiracy thinking out of the American mainstream. ",3
P-9hO4wF_xw,there was little Jeffrey Epstein wouldn't do to satisfy his lust for young women and girls he spent millions masterminding a worldwide sex trafficking operation a year ago he was arrested and a month after that died in custody investigators though refused to let this scandal go to the grave with him they shifted their attention to his high-profile friends among them Prince Andrew who continues to dodge requests from the FBI for an interview but now there's been a substantial breakthrough with the arrest of socialite Gillan Maxwell accused of being Epstein's right-hand woman she's been charged with multiple child sex offenses and for the first time in a long time the countless victims in this wicked saga are feeling relief instead of terror little son James in the Virgin Islands is a picture-perfect playground for the super-rich but it's never been seen like this before this now abandoned Island is the keeper of terrible secrets a place haunted by what went on here at the hands of the now dead Jeffrey Epstein a man who knew no limits in 2003 as he told a reporter this island was his world ran by his rules and what a dark personality it was driven to sexually abuse countless young girls his private sanctuary an isolated prison known as pedo island where he would share the girls like prey with his rich and powerful friends we weren't anything important to them at all we weren't even a human being to them we were just another toy to be passed around and that's what they did Jeffrey Epstein may be dead but the fight for justice is not today we announce the arrest of one of the villains in this investigation just four days ago Glenn Maxwell the most wanted woman in the world was found hiding out in New Hampshire she ruined so many lives she belongs in jail you want to hurt kids that's where you go Epstein's number-one co-conspirator finally arrested after a year on the run helped him exploit girls who were as young as 14 years old she's repellent she's truly evil now a new criminal investigation on Epstein's Caribbean island exposes the true extent of this predators shocking behavior what happened under the sink James it was so horrifying their actions were just reprehensible and adds pressure on Prince Andrew still hiding in the palace refusing to be interviewed by the FBI Byrnes andrew has simply totally stole all of all Epstein's victims it's the allegations of Virginia Robert's true frei that has had the most fallout around the world amongst many others she claims Epstein trafficked her to Prince Andrew three times the first in London when she was 17 then once in New York and the third and final time here in the Virgin Islands Prince Andrew close friends with Glenn Maxwell denies the allegations the third time that you were trafficked to him were you alone with him no there were a lot of younger girls with us and it was it was very shocking how many young women with you I believe there were eight Prince Andrew met abstain through Maxwell a British socialite daughter of disgraced media Baron Robert Maxwell with Gillen Maxwell's arrest how do you think Prince Andrew is feeling right now Oh Prince Andrew should be panicking at the moment because Gillen doesn't really care about anyone else but Keeling it's all a bear in her artwork [Music] mariya farmer is filling her canvas with the Epstein story the bad and the ugly for her a story that started in 1995 it was then as a gifted student at the New York Academy of Art she met patrons Jeffrey Epstein and Glenn Maxwell it makes me really sad because the only thing I did wrong was I went to the wrong graduate school that's the only thing I did wrong Jeffrey fell in love with Maria's art bought her first major work and hired her in 1995 to buy art for his New York mansion during that year she had a front-row seat to what went on behind these closed doors and saw Glenn Maxwell in full flight she would turn like that and like a schools getting out she's like I've got to get the new vials I'm going to get the new vials what did she mean by that and what did you witness so several times I was in the car with her and she would ask the driver to stop the car and she dashed across to the school or the park or wherever she was going and she would like write down her phone number for a child a young girl and then I'd see that child at the house and she'd say they're auditioning you know I found a model in the park and I thought it was really strange because I did see a couple girls in braces and I've never seen a model of braces of course it was a ruse Epstein claimed to help manage Victoria's Secret and Maxwell was his eager model Scout instead as Maria unwittingly witnessed Maxwell was happily procuring girls to feed Epstein's insatiable appetite for sex with teenagers and young women you start getting it all excited and mr. Fisher himself a compulsion Maria would soon experience firsthand he LAN came in to get me one evening um basically they brought me to the Gillan escorts me to Geoffrey's room and he's lying there and he goes well here sit down you know and so right next to him and then he land sits on the other side and they began assaulting me but really while I was lying there the whole time I'm thinking my sister's been around these people my sister was 16 she's been around them alone Maria's fears were well-founded her youngest sister Annie revealed she too was sexually abused by the pair Maria went to the FBI it was 1996 and she was the very first victim to officially report Jeffrey Epstein Angeline Maxwell to the authorities but in a pattern that would be set in the decades ahead her complaint was ignored they just kept it all quiet put in the bottom drawer and they were so dismissive that I just felt daunted and I stopped but by going to police Maria felt the full force of Maxwell's fury terrified Maria went into hiding and gave up her art career what sort of threat so she made against you originally it started with things like I'm gonna burn your arms and then I'm gonna burn your career and then I'm gonna burn you and the house you live in and then it was oh be careful crossing a street you know you can get shot in the back of the head you know they were threats against my life and I told the FBI this do you reflect on how different life would be for so many women today if the FBI had investigated your complaints in 1996 yeah they yeah I think about it all the time I do and it hurts a lot and they never had children because of it because I didn't feel like they would be safe threats he made no bones about that he could inflict harm lies she wanted me to believe that she was Jeffrey's girlfriend and bargains we prosecuted this is the O like none other that I've ever heard of how Epstein and Maxwell she's the repellent way worse than I even understood did whatever they pleased to get away with that makes me very angry that's next on 60 minutes in July last year the slippery Jeffrey Epstein was finally arrested and charged with sex trafficking a minor actually was arrested aboard his private jet for years he'd used his wealth and power to avoid the full brunt of the law the charges allege that Epstein sexually abused young girls by enticing them to engage in sex acts for money but finally apprehended in New York with bail refused and with no other way out lawyer Brad Edwards believes Epstein killed himself in prison despite some speculation he was murdered I think once his bond was revoked just crashed in the only control he had left was over his life so he took a hearing directly from a victim is the only way that anyone's really going to understand Brad represents victims and describes Epstein as a genius sociopath one of his most confounding and dangerous adversaries he was charming charismatic funny he made you want to like him that's why he was able to access over a hundred young girls and do the kind of things that he was able to do you speak about his charisma and charm but he sort of had a double whammy didn't he because he was always implying threats that he could and would hurt you make no bones about that he could yeah inflict harm you know he might say I'll tell you what if you keep prosecuting me this way doing this someone is going to get hurt and so clearly it was a threat you know there's no other way to perceive it but his his delivery was as non-threatening as possible I think they were in disguise they were wolf in sheep's clothing in the early 90s the well-connected Christina Oxenberg a member of the Serbian royal family and a cousin to the British royals met up Steen Angeline Maxwell his alleged Madame now charged with procuring girls for him and sometimes joining in the abuse she wanted me to believe that she was Jeffrey's girlfriend but I knew that she was them but she wanted that to be the storyline how did you know she wasn't his girlfriend because she's not 12 with Epstein's death Maxwell went on the run but Christina remembers the time when both Maxwell and Epstein were desperate to be seen they were a perfect fit they needed each other they were both halves of a whole that they wanted to be he had the money she had the connections did you like Jeffrey Epstein no not at all he was just a Goomba from Queens call me a snob but no he was a typical greedy person who wants more than they already have 66 year old Jeffrey Epstein was in court today for allegedly engaging in sex trafficking crimes how serious are these charges against F Steen David when Epstein's arrests last year made headlines Christina was moved to call the FBI so disturbed was she by what Glenn Maxwell had told her in private all those years ago she was very cocky and she told me that she had just got her helicopter pilot's license and that as gift as to reward her Jeffrey had bought her a helicopter and I said so dangerous why would you want to do that and she said well because this way we have total control on privacy of who's doing who's with us and Maxwell let her in on another secret this time about the infamous lolita express their private plane used to transport young girls and high-profile friends including Bill Clinton she also told me in that meeting that the plane the private plane that she and Jeffrey used was wired first for audio video Christina at the time were there any red flags for you at that point were you thinking children are at risk here unfortunately I did not have even the wherewithal to think of such tremendous evil frankly I just thought she was the sort of rancid personality I had no idea we were dealing with true evil justice has long been denied in this sordid case why did you keep going back [Music] in 2005 an investigation started into epstein for the sexual abuse of more than 40 young girls in Florida [Music] prosecutors had the evidence and the opportunity to put this sexual predator away for life instead Epstein negotiated a secret seedy deal he'd plead guilty to the lesser charge of unlawfully paying for sex with a teenager for which he'd serve just over a year in jail in return he was led off all other charges and incredibly his co-conspirators including Glenn Maxwell were given full immunity in Florida but only for the crimes committed there between 2001 and 2007 the fact that not only was he able to get away with dozens if not hundreds of crimes but also somehow get immunity for his co-conspirators named and unnamed is something that even the judges who have reviewed this case I've never seen with her immunity deal in Florida and since the criminal investigation had run cold Maxwell settled into a luxury hideout aptly named tucked away in New Hampshire it seems Maxwell didn't count on being chased down for her crimes outside the immunity period at her remote court hearing on Thursday where reporters could only listen in thanks to covered Maxwell's disbelief could be heard a very loud British woman screaming why is this happening how is this happening how could this happen and just crying her eyes out Acting US attorney Audrey Strauss as alleged starting in 1994 until at least 1997 maxwell was among Epstein's closest associates and helped him exploit girls who were as young as 14 years old maxwell has been charged with multiple child sex abuse offences relating to the abstain sex ring as well as perjury for lying about it under oath as the world played the whizz gallon guessing game FBI investigators knew all along waiting for the right time to strike we've been discretely keeping tabs on Maxwell's whereabouts as we work this investigation and more recently we learned she had slithered away to a gorgeous property in New Hampshire continuing to live a life of privilege while her victims live with the trauma inflicted upon them years ago haunted by that trauma Virginia Roberts Zhu Frey was not only abused by Epstein and Maxwell but also traffic by them she alleges to some of the most powerful people in the world Virginia is now married and lives in Queensland from where she runs the victims refuse silence foundation news of Maxwell's arrest makes this a good day this day to me has been like one of the best days of my life I have not stopped smiling and crying happy tears and I'm just yeah I am elated to know that she's where she belongs she is the most narcissistic evil vain woman I've ever known and she's finally been knocked off her pedestal coming up the actions are just reprehensible no escape these young girls subject to sexual assault sexual exploitation from an island he'll help us victims get some accountability the women refusing to give up I'm very proud of myself for standing up and what now for the playboy royal the Department of Justice feels Prince Andrew who has simply totally stolen that's nets on 60 minutes Jeffrey Epstein's paradise getaway in the Virgin Islands may now lie abandoned and desolate but it holds the secrets of a sex ring even more extensive than first thought once you get on that island how do you get off the Attorney General of the Virgin Islands Denis George paints a terrifying picture of what confronted the young women who found themselves trapped here it's not like a person who's there and needs help that they can sneak away and run outside and flag down a police car there is now evidence that abstains here in a Florida jail back in 2007 did not stop him from sexually abusing young girls it's alleged he did so until a year before his death here on the Virgin Islands these young girls and women were subject to sexual assault sexual exploitation through coercion false imprisonment where the passports at some points were taken away and it was quite a number of women at least up to 2018 that continued and that is the jaw-dropping aspect of this isn't it so what your investigation is showing is the broad scope of Jeffrey Epstein's nefarious activities that it just kept going based on the evidence that we found thus far and then there's the FBI investigation out of New York which snared ghilane Maxwell it still has its sights on Prince Andrew Virginia Roberts Drew Frey has long maintained she was trafficked to the Prince by Epstein she says she met you in 2001 she dined with you she danced with you and she went on to have sex with you in a house in Belgravia belonging to girl in Maxwell didn't happen it's a claim the Prince famously denied in this car crash interview with the BBC last year no recollection of ever meeting her she was very specific about that night she described dancing with you and you profusely sweating and that she went on to have possibly there's a slight problem with with with with with the sweating because I have a peculiar medical condition which is that I don't sweat or I didn't sweat at the time and that was a machine yes I didn't sweat at the time Prince Andrew is likely sweating right now with her arrest there's speculation Maxwell will reveal all the dark and dirty secrets naming all the men who were party to them in the event that she were to become a cooperator I think that we can deal with that I really hope she comes forward and says ABCDE was involved this is how it ran you know just help us victims get some accountability last month the Duke of York's legal team released a statement claiming he was cooperating with the FBI investigation the Duke of York has on at least three occasions this year offered his assistance as a witness to the department of justice in turn today Prince Andrew yet again sought to falsely portray himself to the public as eager and willing to cooperate the US Department of Justice released its own statement denying Prince Andrew was telling the truth according to Virginia's lawyer David Boies this is an extraordinary step it's very significant in terms of the extent to which the Department of Justice feels Prince Andrew has simply totally stalled what is the endgame here in terms of getting Prince Andrew before the Department of Justice they want to interview him as a witness as somebody who was present at the sex trafficking somebody who was close to Jeffrey Epstein the second thing that they obviously are going to look at is Prince Andrew as a participant just for the record you've been on his private plane yes you've been to stay on his private island yes you've stayed at his home in Palm Beach yes you visited Galen Maxwell's house in Belgravia in London yes Epstein's luxury properties on the island in Paris New York New Mexico and Florida are where so many girls were abused where many of them say they were recruited by Glenn Maxwell and the other co-conspirators everybody needs to be held accountable that was involved with Jeffrey Epstein and in all the crimes they committed Courtney wild was just 14 when she became trapped in Epstein's abusive web for the past 12 years she's been fighting in the courts to make him and all co-conspirators answerable for their crimes I feel like I'm fighting against the biggest baddest people in the world but in the long years since Epstein's arrest and death his victims have just been offered some compassion now able to seek compensation without the pain of lengthy court cases do you have any idea yet of how many women will claim and and what sort of figures we're talking about as individual payouts my expectation is that it's probably somewhere in the range of 50 to 100 I I think I think you're certainly talking about a million dollars or more the recoveries are going to be quite substantial inna move that has shocked and appalled many ghilane Maxwell has also staked a claim on the Epstein estate demanding it pick up her legal bills I'm like what she's doing what I just can't even believe she has the balls to do something like that she basically conspired with him and the fact that she would come back for money after he's passed it's just offensive things would have been very different for Cortney if she had not been hurt like this would have been very different for Virginia if she had not been hurt like this these are very sweet people that have a lot of creativity and they're very smart as women Maria farmer Courtney wild and Virginia Roberts drew Frey are fighting against the unthinkable crimes done to them as teenagers with Epstein dead and Maxwell potentially facing more than 30 years in jail that fight now turns against the other co-conspirators who enabled Epstein to inflict his monstrous acts on the most vulnerable at the end of the day I'm very proud of myself for standing up to somebody like him and putting up a fight regardless of who he was is this the end of the abstain story this is just the beginning there were so many women in Epstein's orbit that participated procured and benefited from Epstein's sickness jeffrey was dirty he was sick he was a pedophile he's gone Gulin she is the wicked one and these women with her they deserve the same punishment they deserve to be taken down as well so just the

I7MBv9FixxE,"Thirty years with the CIA 1964 to 1994. I worked for the government for 35 years starting
with the Marine Corps from 1964 to 1968 with service in Vietnam. I was 25 years as a Professional Intelligence
Officer with CIA. Almost 5 years in the Pentagon, and the last
almost 3 of that working in the Office of Secretary Defense. I spent almost 20 years with the State Department,
3 years in Athens as a political counselor the chief of the political section. I'm a retired colonel of the United States
Army, military intelligence special forces. I was previously with the State Department
office of counter terrorism in 1989 to 1993, part of that I worked with the Central Intelligence
Agency. I'm a former Senior Estimates Officer with
the Central Intelligence Agency. I started actually as a science fellow at
the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and became the chief scientist of the Arms Control
Agency. For 27 years I was an analyst first of Soviet
Affairs and then a wide of responsibilities. I'm a congressman representing the 30th District
in Los Angeles. I've just completed almost 3 decades of service
to the United States. Most recently, I was an Assistant Secretary
of Defense in the Pentagon from 1994 to 2001. I served for 23 years in the American Foreign
Services Diplomat. I worked for the CIA for 28-and-a-half years. I joined the agency in 1988, joining with
what was then known as the National Photographic Interpretation Center. I'm a Washington Editor of the Nation Magazine. I've been doing that for about 16 years now. I'm the Labor MP for our Constituency in Birmingham
for Birmingham Ladywood. I've been the MP for 20 years. For 30 years I was a Diplomat serving my country
abroad and my last position, however, was as Ambassador to Saudi Arabia during the Gulf
War. July of 1970, the president asked to me to
come over to the White House Counsel and I served for roughly 1000 days until it all
fell apart. Twenty-three years as a Commission Officer
of the United States Army. I came back to public service in 2001 to be
the Secretary of the Army. I spent 21 years in the CIA, of that time,
I spent 90% in Middle East. I'm a former Weapons Inspector with the United
Nations in Iraq. I served in that capacity from 1991 to 1998. I worked for the CIA for 20 years from 1966
to 1986. I've worked on assessing secret nuclear weapons
programs for almost 20 years. Never expected that I'd leave the Navy and
become the chief spoke of our country, the Director of Central Intelligence but that
happened. Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction. Iraq weapons of mass destruction. A clear threat to the United States. There's dozens of ballistic. It is sponsored and sheltered terrorists. Paying suicide bombers. Chemical weapons are equally. Biological weapons including anthrax and botulism
toxins. Biological and chemical agents to kill millions
of people. Chemical weapons including VX and Sarin, mustard
gas. To a massive and sudden horror. Massive death and destruction. Death on a massive scale. The danger to our country is grave. The danger to our country is growing. The Iraqi Regime possesses biological and
chemical weapons. The Iraqi Regime is building the facilities
necessary to make more biological and chemical weapons. And according to the British Government, the
Iraqi Regime could launch a biological or chemical attack in as little as 45 minutes
after the order were given. The Regime has long-standing and continuing
ties to terrorist's organizations and their Al-Qaeda terrorists inside Iraq. The Regime is seeking a nuclear bomb and with
fissile material could build one within a year. The Bush Administration made its mind to go
to war on September the 11th, 2001. That very first day on September 12, one day
after September 11, the meeting that was held in the White House in the Situation Room led
to Rumsfeld asking the question, ""Shouldn't we use this as an opportunity to do something
about Iraq as well'? We all said, ""But no, no Al-Qaeda is in Afghanistan
we need to bomb Afghanistan"" and Rumsfeld said, ""There aren't any good targets in Afghanistan
and there are lots of good targets in Iraq."" From that time on, you were dealing with rationalization
and justification for the war. You weren't dealing with real causes for the
war or real reasons for the war. There was never clear present danger. There was never an imminent threat. With weapons of mass destruction. Weapons of mass destruction. Weapons of mass death. Weapons of mass destruction was a convenient
way of tricking our congress into giving the president authority to wage this war. Saddam has resumed his efforts to acquire
nuclear weapons. Develop nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons. It was clear that Iraq did not have a nuclear
weapons program but over and over again, President Bush, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld particularly
Vice-President Cheney but also National Security Advisor Condi Rice drummed up the idea of
a reconstituted nuclear capability and particularly the notion that I think has some residence
of wronging the American people of the ""Mushroom Cloud."" Leaders will use worse case assessments that
point to nuclear weapons to generate political support because they know people fear nuclear
weapons so much. The evidence was simply not there. [Inaudible] would asked to explain, you know,
how good is the evidence? Can you tell us more about it? This is NATO mind you and he'd say, ""Well,
it's like this it's like pornography. Hard to describe but you recognize it when
you see it."" My God! And we're going to war on that? If someone is waiting for a so-called smoking
gun, it's certain that we will have waited too long. We don't want the smoking gun to be a mushroom
cloud. We cannot wait for the final proof, the smoking
gun. It could come in the form of a mushroom cloud. So, a lot people who supported the war in
Iraq actually believed that Iraq had the capability to fire missiles that could reach the United
States carrying payloads of nuclear or chemical or biological weapons. Iraq has never had the capability to do that. They didn't have in the first Gulf War. They didn't have it in this war in Iraq and
they don't have it, anyway of getting it in the future. What the Bush Administration did was try to
round up as many people as they could who would make the case for them. What the White House wanted was the CIA to
give it talking points to justify this war, it already made up its mind. Massive intervention by people particularly
from Vice-President Cheney's office and Vice-President Cheney himself in the process. And I think the intelligence analysts found
themselves really up against it when they tried to argue that those connections weren't
as tight as people were saying. Intelligence director of the Department of
Energy simply ordered his experts who has raised questions about the evidence being
used on the nuclear end of it as the news accounts say ""to sit down and shut up"" so
that the DOE would be onboard with the overall estimate. They were not given the opportunity to speak
because no one wanted to hear what they said. And I was in chief of collecting information
on Iraq through the mid90s. I know what we had and what we didn't have
and I'm here to tell you there was no information. I understand that the director himself, George
Tenet is now accompanying the briefer in the morning and this never happened in the past. In the past we were trusted, there were senior
people, we knew what the score was and when I hear that George Tenet is going down with
the senior briefer I wonder why. And the very heavy leaning on the director
of Central Intelligence and his staff to produce precisely the language which would allow them
to make the statements which they had been making to support the decision to go into
Iraq. Well, not only by their physical presence
but by the questions they asked, by the ""well don't you think?"" sort of things, ""well couldn't it be possible
that?"" They call this data mining, going back over
old information and coming with new conclusions. And the overwhelming opinion from the scientists
of this government at the Department or Energy and even at the CIA and some of the State
Department were arguing against using weapons of mass destruction as a case to go to war. You're talking about the Vice-President of
the United States and you're talking about a GS-13 or 14, a midlevel analyst in the Central
Intelligence Agency. You're talking about a person who should have
career protection for telling it like it is but who knows that his chief, the director
of the CIA is a member of the team, you know? A lot of pressure on that. It shouldn't happen. The whole purpose the CIA was to leave those
people out at Langley that's why they're not in Washington, they're in Northern Virginia
away from the White House, away from congress, leave them alone, ask them what they think
but don't tell them to rethink their positions because then you come up with nonsense like
we saw. The administration had decided very early
on that Saddam should go and that in itself is not a bad goal, but of course, everything
depends on how you do it when, how, where, with whom, etcetera. Preemptive war by its very nature is something
that is entirely new to the United States of America and to what we call the old western
alliance. That's, you know, you go back through history
and at the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 a group of nations that had just killed most of each
other off decided that this isn't quite the way to do it and they came up with a set of
laws that we've all lived with fairly well since then which doesn't much allow for preemptive
war. Delay in decision and in action could lead
to a massive and sudden horror. It simply makes no sense to wait any longer. Take action before it's too late. We will not wait. I believe it is essential that when we see
a threat we deal with those threats before they become imminent. It's too late if they become imminent. As President Bush has said, ""time is not on
our side."" It was a rushed and I believe it was done
I believe in 3 or 4 weeks which is really fast for that. It wasn't done earlier from what I understand
because the Bush Administration didn't want such a document that had caveats. That's why they never asked for a comprehensive
National Intelligence Estimate within the intelligence community on this particular
problem because they knew the intelligence community didn't agree on any of these issues. The National Intelligence Estimate is really
about, I don't know 5 major players but 10 intelligence agencies in total weighing in
on the basic situation with weapons of mass destruction. It only happened because the head of the senate
intelligence committee, Graham called for it and so I think the Bush Administration
resisted having an NIE and then once it was out, selectively picked what was useful to
their argument. Most of their qualifications were simply filtered
out. The standardization of the original estimate
was not true to its real meaning. All the modifiers were dropped off. It was a prosecutor making a case using what
benefited his case ignoring evidence that would undermine his case and there was no
defensive attorney to give us the other side. And the end product used by policy makers
particularly in its discussion with the American public were much more forceful than could
have possibly been when originally written by CIA, DIA or State Departments Intelligence
and Research. It was a bizarre warping of the intelligence
process and they thought they would be able to get away with it because who's going to
see the classified version? Well, later several months later, they released
parts of the classified version. They thought no one would notice. So, this was not a case where the National
Intelligence Estimate was driving the war. This was to provide an excuse after the fact. Going to war based on intelligence is yet
another example, I think, of intelligence simply not being able by nature, by definition
to live up to that kind of requirement. You may produce intelligence that could keep
you out of a war but I doubt that you'll ever get 1, 2, 3 reports of intelligence that will
in any way allow you to go to war. There are Al-Qaeda in Iraq. Saddam Hussein cavorts with terrorists. Secretly, without fingerprints he could provide
one is hidden weapons to terrorists or help them develop their own. Well, the war really has absolutely nothing
to do with terrorism. There was no connection whatsoever between
Iraq and the secular regime there and the religious fanatics who perpetrated 9/11. They wanted to believe that there was a connection
but the CIA was sitting there, the FBI was sitting there, I was sitting there saying
""we've looked this issue for years, for years we have looked for a connection."" Well, there's just no connection. Saddam was not a maniac or a fool. He was a terrible villain, yes but he was
not going to sacrifice his own life and the future of his country to stupid adventures
with terrorists who had completely antithetical views to his. It is just inconceivable to anybody who understands
Saddam Hussein and understands the nature of highly centralized dictatorships. Generally, that dictators would want to give
up control of their most potent weaponry because once you've given up control, you have no
control so you can't say to Al-Qaeda you will use this or you won't use it. The decision of whether or not they're going
to use it depends on what Osama bin Laden does. Do you want to entrust your fate to Osama
bin Laden and his nihilistic ways? I don't think so, Saddam Hussein is a psychopath
and sociopath, he was not an irrational being in the sense he was going to ensure his own
demise by doing something like that. Al-Qaeda has had total contempt for Saddam
Hussein himself. He's been a socialist. He's been very harsh. He's treated Islamic leaders, Islamist leaders
extremely harshly. Iraq and we have very good intelligence on
this. It was not part of the picture of terrorism
before we invaded. Saddam Hussein and Bin Laden where enemies. Bin Laden considered and said that Saddam
Hussein was the socialist infidel. These were very different kinds of individuals
competing for power in their own way and Saddam Hussein made very sure that Al-Qaeda couldn't
function in Iraq, that terrorists couldn't function except for the small northeastern
quadrant of the country where was and extremist group but he had no control over that. I was near the Iranian border. There's no doubt that Ansar al-Islam is a
radicle Islamic terrorist group with ties to Al-Qaeda but they operate in a part of
Iraq that is not controlled by Hussein. The leaders say they seek to overthrow Hussein
and his government. They are our enemy, really they are also our
enemy. We believe that Saddam Hussein, him and his
group and his ministers, also they are outside of Islamist zone. And the ties with Al-Qaeda was just a scare
tactic to exploit the trauma, the very real trauma that the American people have felt
ever since 9/11 and to associate that trauma with Iraq. As you know from the polls, most Americans
believe that Iraq had something to do with 9/11 and it was a very successful, very deliberate
and very unethical and immoral operation on the part of the PR people in this administration. We now know that Saddam has resumed his efforts
to acquire nuclear weapons. Among other sources we've gotten this from
firsthand testimony from defectors. Access to immigrants and defectors with more
direct access to these programs. From 3 Iraqi defectors we know that Iraq in
the late 1990s had several mobile biological weapons. It's only after defectors told us about it. Their inspectors were in the country. The most important information that inspectors
have ever gotten on what's going on in Iraq have come from defectors. We know about that capability from defectors
and other sources. A recent defector stated that as recently
as August of 19/08 that's while inspections were still going on, a formal order was issued
to proceed with a nuclear program at full blast. Our strategy is to bring to the world the
danger that Saddam poses in his current state. Without doubt, he is developing weapons of
mass destruction. Without doubt, he has chemical and biological
weapons and without doubt, for 30 years he has been trying to acquire a nuclear weapon. The usual scrutiny of these kind of guys was
just not done adequately, that there was this attitude of let's find the smoking gun, let's
find the evidence rather than let's look at what's out there and weigh the evidence. They wanted to believe him. It goes back to contacts that originated as
early as the 1990s with individuals like Dick Cheney, like Paul Wolfowitz, like Richard
Perle dealing with Ahmad Chalabi. They became enamored of this fellow who dressed
like a westerner, talked with a British accent and appeared to be uppercrossed and therefore
was quite believable. And everyone in Washington was believing them
and I thought people had really somehow checked out of reality in order to go to war, that
is a war fever that had taken over. These people wanted to get back into Bagdad. They couldn't defeat Saddam Hussein but they
knew that U.S. Military power could, so the worst of these offenders who would be Ahmad
Chalabi who has been in exile for his own country for 20 to 30 years and is clearly
not a hero under any definition of heroism to his own people sold the Pentagon on the
idea that Saddam Hussein did have weapons of mass destruction and he must be stopped. But they were bringing forward individuals
who they claimed were either high-level military or scientist with access. They were looking for money first of all cause
Chalabi was paying money. Supplying money shouldn't be a surprise. That's how informants are dealt with in the
spy business. But there was no effort to check their bonafides,
none. Every checkable piece of that intelligence
that's come to public notice has proven to be false or at least self-serving in the extreme. You had the U.S. Congress approve and appropriate
money for the Iraqi National Congress with no telling how much they were taking off the
top for themselves. You get all kinds of people who want a reward
and have nothing to offer and many ended up with Chalabi because they would believe anything
bad about Iraq. It was phony evidence, it was based on intelligence
we had from Iraqi exiles who wanted this country to attack Iraq so these people could then
take over in Bagdad and establish their own regime. We have to back and examine just the role
that the defectors played throughout the entire inspection process. The inspections work then you don't overthrow
Saddam Hussein. How does somebody like that, I don't know
even how to describe him, get into a position where he's determining U.S. policies? Senior members of the Department of Defense
gave him their thumbs up. His information was coming into the White
House to people like Dick Cheney through the Office of Special Plans, so it was coming
in through an avenue that's not traditional to the intelligence community and wasn't open
to being vetted or reviewed. You had Chalabi himself admit that they didn't
mind providing false information cause it helped them to achieve their goal of removing
Saddam. Nobody in Iraq will defend that regime including
the military, both the regular army and the Republican Guard. Our liberation would not have been achieved
without the determination of President George W. Bush and the commitment of the Coalition
at the forefront of which stand the people of the United States of America and Great
Britain. The Iraqis will never forget your courage
and sacrifice on our behalf. We are here today to declare that the new
Iraq is born and Iraq with dignity, justice and human rights are assured for all citizens. There is no risk of a breakup of Iraq. There is no risk of a civil war. I stand before this assembly as a representative
of free Iraq. To all those here who helped us in our struggle
for liberation we extend our gratitude. The Iraqi opposition will ensure that the
continuation of it' institutions and to reestablish democracy and the rule of law. He said, ""I got what I wanted. I got my war. I'm back in Iraq and if you people relied
on my information you're stupid."" Every year by law and by custom we meet here
to consider the State of the Union. This year we gather in this chamber deeply
aware of decisive days that lie ahead. Bush presented so many distorted beliefs,
estimates and guestimates that it appears that he was misleading the public and the
congress. Saddam Hussein had the materials to produce
as much as 500 tons of Sarin, mustard and VX nerve agent. Any Sarin that they were making in 1990-1991
had a known shelf life about 2 months. I have confirmed this with inspectors and
analysts who were deeply involved in the 1990s analyses. Well, if you made it 12 years ago and it had
a shelf life of 2 months, it may not be safe to drink but it isn't Sarin nerve gas any
longer and there is no way the agency could not have known that. U.S. Intelligence indicates that Saddam Hussein
had upwards of 30,000 munitions capable of delivering chemical agents. Inspectors recently turned up 16 of them despite
Iraq's recent declaration, denying their existence. And then they tried to use the fact that inspectors
found 16 of these as evidence that thousands more existed, and again, I mean as a methodology
it's a very weak way to predict anything and I think it borders on propaganda to argue
that the small number that had been found by inspectors implied that in this case, over
29,000 exists. Saddam Hussein has not accounted for the remaining
29,984 of these prohibited munitions. Put it this way, Bush Administration officials
either routinely said or tried to give the impression that if Iraq had not fully accounted
for all of a certain item related to chemical or biological weapons, then it must be there
and that's not all what the inspectors said or found. He hadn't accounted for that material. He's given no evidence that he has destroyed
it. And the inspectors could go in and say, okay
we can prove yeah you destroyed that set in this way or that set in that way but these
others we can't prove it and that doesn't mean that they didn't destroy these warheads
or whatever the item was, it just means Iraq hadn't been able to prove it. If Saddam Hussein had admitted to the Iranians,
to the Syrians and his own people that he had been so intimated by the U.N. inspection
and sanctions process that he had given up all that, they probably would have torn him
limb from limb. Saddam Hussein had materials sufficient to
produce more than 38,000 liters of botulin toxin, enough to subject millions of millions
of people to death by respiratory failure. He hadn't accounted for that material. Revealed his biological weapons program, particularly
it' ability to make botulin toxin and therefore it was an open issue, but again, it doesn't
mean that what the inspectors found was evidence that Iraq possessed that. Our intelligence sources tell us that he has
attempted to purchase high-strength aluminum tubes suitable for nuclear weapons production. I think there was very little doubt that the
centrifuge tubes, so-called were nothing but rocket motor tubes to go into M-81 style artillery
rockets. They certainly have all the specs for that. Nuclear experts, for instance, from Lawrence
Livermore's laboratory's Z division, the experts on centrifuge in Richmond came out and said,
""No you couldn't enrich uranium using these tubes. They're not compatible."" Well, I saw it as a deliberate attempt to
take information, selectively take information and try to basically say Iraq poses and imminent
nuclear threat and therefore action is absolutely necessary and I felt that was absolutely wrong. International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed
in the 1990s that Saddam Hussein had an advanced Nuclear Weapons Development Program. The administration showed photos of nuclear
or former nuclear weapon sites in Iraq pre-1991 nuclear weapons sites; claimed that new construction
showed they were ongoing nuclear weapons production sites, complete nonsense. The most troubling thing about the fact of
the distortions and the misleading statements that Bush gave congress is that it is a federal
felony, it's a crime to mislead and distort information and present it to the congress. The British Government has learned that Saddam
Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa. When Secretary Powell addressed the U.N. about
weapons of mass destruction he deliberately left out any reference to attempts to buy
uranium from Africa. I didn't use the uranium at that point because
I didn't think that was sufficiently strong as evidence to present before the world. CIA officials warn members of the President's
staff the intelligence was not good enough to make the statement ""Iraq tried to buy uranium
from Africa."" In October for the Cincinnati speech not for
the State of the Union, but the Cincinnati speech, George Tenet asked that this be taken
out of the Cincinnati speech, the reference to yellowcake. It was taken out of the Cincinnati speech
because whenever the Director of Central Intelligence wants something out, it's gone. How did it get back in? It's not a matter of getting back in, it's
a matter Tim that 3 plus months later people didn't remember that George Tenet had asked
that it be taken out of the Cincinnati speech and that is was cleared by the agency. The British Government has learned that Saddam
Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa. Just 16 words in the State of the Union Address,
words that we now know where misleading. A retired career diplomat Joe Wilson tried
to warn the administration of just that nearly a year before the speech. I received a call from the CIA in February
of 2002 and I was invited out to talk to those people within the broader intelligence community
who deal with 3 different subjects; Iraq, uranium and Niger. I briefed them on what I knew about the uranium
business. It was during the course of that briefing
that they said that they had received a report that had peaked the interest of the office
of the Vic-President and that report was of a purported memorandum of agreement authorizing
the sale of uranium yellowcake somewhat enriched uranium from Niger to Iraq and it was a document
that was executed by the government of Niger. They asked me if I would be willing to go
out and take another look at it and talk to people I knew there. I left there telling them that if they wanted
I would be able to free up my schedule, they subsequently called me and said ""please do."" I spent the 8 days drinking mint tea and talking
to everybody there was to talk to who knew anything about the subject matter and [inaudible]
and I had come back persuaded that it could not have happened, one from a business perspective
because of the way the consortium was structured, you just couldn't do it without a lot of people
knowing and two, the way the government bureaucracy was structured you could not make the decision
without a lot of people knowing and if you made the decision, the decision would be reflected
in a series of signatures on the documents and if the documents did not contain those
signatures they could not be authentic government of these are your documents. President quoted a British paper, we did not
know at the time, no one knew at the time in our circles, maybe someone knew down in
the bowels of the agency but no one in our circles knew that there were doubts and suspicions
that this might be a forgery. Of course, it was information that was mistaken
but the, it was a relatively small part of the case about nuclear weapons and nuclear
reconstitution. It is also the case that the broad picture
about Iraq's programs was a picture that went very far back in time. Now, given what I knew about where the question
had originated and given what I knew about the way the government works, I knew that
people in her circle did know. Based on thorough analysis, [inaudible] has
conclude with the concurrence of outside expert that these documents which form the basis
for the reports of recent uranium transaction between Iraq and Niger are in fact not authentic. Numerous French words were misspelled in the
documents. One of the letters was signed by a Niger official
who had left office 10 years ago. Several dates in the documents did not match
the day of the week. Several of the names and titles of officials
mentioned in the documents were incorrect. We all know that the documentation on yellowcake
from Niger was a fake but why doesn't anybody say who did it? Who faked the document and why don't we take
another look at then at the same stream of consciousness that was prevailing at that
moment on the aluminum tubes and the, even the trailers the bioweapons trailers that
were so badly hid, at that point someone's got to say, who is putting this intelligence
out there and why? And I don't think that question has been answered
and maybe because the answer is known and it's not a pleasant one. Who was it that asked for this review of the
Niger nuclear material question? It was the Vice-President. Mr. Wilson, former Ambassador was sent to
Niger in response to the Vice-President's questions about this issue, so assumedly the
Vice-President got a report back in response to his question and that report contained
the Wilson memo, his assessment of the situation. The question remains, who did the document? Who forged the document and why? You know, the list is possibly short, somebody
ought to be able to work on that. Wilson says his family is the subject of a
smear campaign by Senior Administration Officials. They deliberating leaked his wife's identity
as a covert CIA operative damaging her future career and compromising past missions after
he criticized the administration on Meet the Press and in the New York Times. The White House hatchet then came out and
started writing articles in which they basically said that Wilson, well the first one came
out and said that Wilson told the truth cause he's a democrat; we'll set that up as an argument. Democrats tell the truth, [inaudible] republicans
fill in the blank. Then a couple of senior administration officials
leak to Bob Novak that my wife was a CIA operative involved in the weapons of mass destruction
business at the CIA. Senior administration officials is a key to
being very, typically the President, Vice-President, cabinet officers and the top of the White
House had gone out of their way to get that information out not only told Novak, told
Time magazine they wanted the information out. Now, that's against a statutory law what prohibits
the identification of CIA operatives. What you're doing when you expose a CIA officer
of any name, you're basically taking their entire career and flushing it down the toilet. It also has the potential of placing that
person in jeopardy because of their operations and their own operations and people they have
operated with in jeopardy, so it is a very vengeful act against the ambassador to try
to hurt him by hurting his wife's career if not wishing him physical damage. I had never seen a dirty trick that could
be a hit. A President of the United States and an administration
who has come to office on a platform of restoring dignity and honor the White House what they
did was neither dignified nor was it terribly honorable nor was it germane to be the issue
at hand. First of all it should be noted that Colin
Powell's speech to the United Nations was theater, a masterful theater, effective theater
at the time. You know, here's a man who has tremendous
credibility who presents himself to the security council, to the American people, to the international
public and stares the camera in the eye and says ""he knows Iraq has weapons of mass destruction."" Leaving Saddam Hussein in possession of weapons
of mass destruction for a few more months or years is not an option. My first visual impression here watching George
Tenet be head of the Central Intelligence Agency back there as a prop almost like a
potted plant as if to say that the Central Intelligence Agency stands behind, or in this
case sits behind everything that Colin Powell says that was a terrific blow to the moral
of the Central Intelligence Agency analysts. Saddam Hussein has chemical weapons. Chemical weapons, although they can be very
deadly in a subway station or something like this are not really strategic weapons. They are weapons that can kill 50, 100, 200
people, but in fact, they won't devastate you the way a nuclear weapon in New York City
or Chicago or someplace would be a deadly blow. Saddam Hussein has used these horrific weapons
on another country and on his own people. He used weapons, Saddam Hussein did back in
the 1980s when the U.S, Administration, the Reagan Administration was actually supporting
him and allowing him to import the, of the chemical precursors for that. Donald Rumsfeld would actually as a special
envoy for Ronald Reagan back in those years helped, you know, open the door for better
relations between Washington and Bagdad. Colin Powell spoke of thousands of leaders
of anthrax that were unaccounted for. He said they're probably hiding it and then
held up a little vial of white powder and he said, a couple teaspoonfuls of white powder
like this if launched against American cities could kill thousands of Americans. If he was truly to reflect the Iraqi capability,
he would held up a bottle of diet Coke and said the Iraqis produce anthrax that looked
like this. It has a shelf life of 3 years. The last known production batch came out in
1991, so even if Iraq was hiding this brown sludge liquid, it would be useless today. Just a few weeks ago we intercepted communications
between 2 commanders in Iraq's second Republican Guard Corps. If you know anything about Iraq they have
very strict communications security procedures. So, you would never have military personnel
speaking in the clear over a radio about sensitive subjects. On the left is a close up of 1 of the 4 chemical
bunkers. There were never any chemical weapons in that
facility. I'm intimately familiar with that facility. I've inspected it a number of times. Other inspectors have inspected it many more
times than I have. To believe they were proof is to believe the
statement that Iraq would put its crown jewels in the one building or one of the few buildings
that either the United States will bomb first or the inspectors will go to first. The truck you also see is signature item,
it's a decontamination vehicle. The U.N. Weapon Inspectors knew that the truck
shown by Colin Powell in those photographs were firetrucks not decontamination trucks. I would have to comment here on Secretary
of State Colin Powell's debut as an imagery analyst. It was highly embarrassing for those of us
who know about something about the business. We couldn't tell whether this was an honest
mistake by those who now do the imagery analysis, who now report to the Secretary of Defense
unlike our day when they reported to the Central Intelligence Agency. Whether that was the case or whether perhaps
Colin Powell was being setup. From our point of view, I mean we do all kinds
of analysis of satellite imagery. You can't form any conclusions on what's going
on inside the building. They could have been building tractors. They could have been doing nothing inside
the facility. Now look at the picture on the right. You are now looking at 2 of those sanitized
bunkers. The signature vehicles are gone. It's been cleaned up and it was done on the
22nd of December as the U.N. inspection team is arriving. Contamination vehicles, they rotate from site
to site and so the absence of the vehicle on the second photo which we know is the 22nd
of December, could just as easily be explained by the normal rotation because you didn't
tell us the date of the first and it was several weeks before. We have noted that the 2 satellite images
of the sites were taken several weeks apart. The report of movement of munitions at the
site could just as easily had been a routine activity as a movement or prescribed munitions
in anticipation of imminent inspection. We have firsthand description of biological
weapons factories on wheels and rails. These mobile labs that have been shown to
be nothing more than hydrogen generation facilities. Here you see both truck and railcar mounted
mobile factories. When you take a look at the mobile labs that
Colin Powell discussed, he didn't put up photographs of these facilities. He put up artists renditions of these facilities. Why? Because we have no proof they exist. This video of an Iraqi test flight obtained
by UNSCOM some years ago shows an Iraqi F-1 Mirage jet aircraft. Note the spray coming from beneath the Mirage. That is 2000 liters of simulated anthrax. Iraqis continue to visit Bin Laden in his
new home in Afghanistan. George Tenet's analysts has spent a year-and-a-half
of tortuous investigation, tortuous analysis to see if there were ties between Al-Qaeda
and Iraq. They found none. Our conservative estimate is that Iraq today
has a stockpile between 100 and 500 tons of chemical weapons agent. So, the Secretary of State is telling us that
our conservative estimate is that Iraq possess between 100 and 500 tons of chemical weapons
agent, enough to fill 16,000 warheads on the battle field. Where are they? What happened to them? My suspicion is that this is not our conservative
estimate that this sounds very much to me like our nail conservative estimate. Iraqi denials of supporting terrorism take
their place alongside the other Iraqi denials of weapons of mass destruction. It is all a web of lies. It was a masterful performance but none of
it was true. Where are all these weapons? Where is all this VX? Where is all the anthrax? Probably one of the low points in his long
distinguished service to the nation. The old weapons inspection process was a little
more than a game. They concealed, denied, deceived. Return of inspectors would provide no assurance
whatsoever. To eliminate by inspection is quite frankly
a fool's errand. On the contrary, there's a great danger that
it would provide false comfort that Saddam was somehow back in his box. Reality is that between the original UNSCOM
inspections and the UNMOVIC inspections you destroyed with those inspections 90 to probably
95% of the Iraqi arsenal. The first Gulf War destroyed almost nothing
and, you know, postwar U.S. battle damage assessments confirmed that. The weapons inspectors were effective. They forced Saddam to get rid of his stuff. They had the country under control. By 1998 at the latest, those inspectors had
discovered most of the weapons of mass destruction and the Iraqi programs at that point were
essentially at an end. Before the war in Iraq, the United Nations
Inspectors told us that Saddam Hussein did not have nuclear weapons capability. Ironically the major effect of the invasion
of Iraq in terms of weapons of mass destruction has been to show that the inspectors were
right along. The inspection regime worked. It was the most intrusive inspection regime
in history and it worked and at the end of the day that's another reason why we went
to war for nothing. These maniacs who are encouraging out enemies,
weakening our troops resolve and confusing the American people. Well, you shouldn't listen to these protests
because they're obviously helping Saddam Hussein. Who would have guessed that you could build
a massive international peace movement on the protection of Saddam Hussein? The media is culpable for the misleading of
the American public. They bought into the Bush Administration's
rederick. They don't understand that there is moral
violence and immoral violence. We use moral violence, God bless this president. He is truly a great man. Reducing troop morale, confusing the American
people and emboldening our enemies. They are absolutely committing sedition and
treason as far as I'm concerned. There's huge difference between personal opinion
and an opinion which degrades on the basis on military in a time of war. It's a disgrace. I don't believe that mainstream media acted
responsibly in regards to Iraq. You know, I was belittle, I was called a trader. I was called crazy, Paula Zahn of CNN accused
me of drinking Saddam Hussein's Kool Aid for making accurate statements in response to
aluminum tubes. People out there are accusing you of drinking
Saddam Hussein's Kool Aid. If an idea log, then I'm a republican idea
log, I'm actually a fairly conservative person who voted for George W. Bush but I don't allow
my ideology to get in the way of the facts and the reality in my duties and responsibilities
as an American citizen. There's a tendency if you want to kill the
message to go after the messenger. If you can discredit the messenger then you
can discredit the message or if you can make the story about the messenger then people
forget about the message. And I think it's so unfair to try to silence
debate and criticism by attacking those who say something of which you disagree. The media is supposed to be the force of state
but they decided to completely climb in bed with the administration on this. In a way, the administration constructed a
box where, and that was, that box had all the information that the administration wanted
the media and the public and congress to have. What they would do is you'd have the Iraqi
National Congress taking bogus defector's information from them, giving them to the
Pentagon and then the Iraqi National Congress, then giving them to the journalists and they
said if you don't believe us, the Iraqi National Congress call up the Pentagon. So, you had this circular reporting and you've
had the New York Times admitting that it was using one source for all of its information
on weapons of mass destruction and it was, you know, self-affirming by going to the Pentagon
which put this stuff on paper. It was a lot of exaggerations, partial information
sometimes the whole information but on balance, a very one-sided view of Iraq's WMD Program. And a lot of these stories the journalists
didn't want to look into because the editors told them to run with it, we're going to be
supportive with the administration it's the patriotic thing to do. I think that was, on the part of the media,
too much of in a sense getting into the upcoming war and not enough look at do we really need
to go? There some journalists out there raising the
alarm bells. The Seymour Hershes, the Walter Pincuses of
the world but unfortunately those great investigative reporters they're usually exiled when the
heat is on and it's only after the fact that they end up being praised and given the pats
on the back. The excitement was to make the case to go
to war, you know, to show that, you know, and that was the controversy to the media
[inaudible] is, you know, it was the titillation of a WMD hitting us not the titillation of,
or the conflict of tacky administration. Both Washington Post and New York Times, they
have very conservative editors that supported the White House on this. I didn't foresee all of this. I'd like to say oh I was very prescient. I knew that the others in the Intelligence
Community were saying I didn't and I'm one of the ones who also I drank the Kool Aid,
but early on I felt that there was some real dangers going into the war and I tried to
get an op-ed into various major newspapers and the word kept coming back, nobody wants
to hear this cause we're going to war. The people of the United States and our friends
and allies will not live at the mercy of an outlaw regime that threatens the peace with
weapons of mass murder. His regime has an active program to acquire
and develop nuclear weapons and let there be no doubt about it. We know for a fact that there are weapons
there. There were a group of people who for many
years had advocated going after Saddam Hussein and they pushed this hard and, of course,
raw intelligence data can be interpreted in a lot of different ways, as I'm sure experts
will talk to about and so there were a group of people I think that were adamant that this
was the right course to pursue. We found the weapons of mass destruction,
you know, we found biological laboratories. Everybody knows that Iraq had weapons of mass
destruction. I have reason, every reason to believe that
the intelligence that we operating off was correct. No question, we have said that Saddam Hussein
possess biological and chemical weapons. We know where they are, there in the area
around Tikrit and Bagdad and east, west, south and north somewhat. This would be nuclear and, of course, the
operation for whatever duration it takes. Are you confident that you'll find weapons
of mass destruction? I believe we will find evidence of the programs
of chemical and biological weapons, yes. How about the actual weapons? Well, I just don't know. Let's wait and see what the team that's over
there. Sanctions continue with our new exploitation
teams that have been brought in. And that we will in fact find weapons or evidence
of weapon programs that are conclusive. It is somewhat puzzling I think that you can
have a 100% certainty about the weapons of mass destructions existence and zero certainty
about where they are. Do you agree and does it matter whether or
not you have these weapons? We might ask the Prime Minister that. We won't be proven wrong. This is a process that takes some time and
it will ebb and flow. One thing we know is that he had a Weapons
Programs. I don't know anybody that I can think of who
has contended that the Iraqis had nuclear weapons. We believe he has in fact reconstituted nuclear
weapons. But on the specific issue of weapons of mass
destruction it's going to take time and we're going to be patient. With time, the truth will come out. Now, it's going to take time to find anything
because they've had, they've. People will find that we presented a solid
case, as case that is there and it was there and will remain there. It's going to take a period of time to find
the people. I don't think we'll discover anything myself. Still thought that 3-and-a-half months for
new inspections was a rather short time before calling it a day and especially when we now
see that they say the U.S. Government is saying that look you have to
a bit of patience, you know, these things take time. I believe that we will find the truth and
the truth is he was developing a program for weapons of mass destruction. I think what will happen is we'll discover
people who will tell us where to go to find it. You're not going find it simply in a house
you're going to search, you're going to find it when people start to talk to you. It is not like a treasure hunt where you just
run around looking everywhere hoping you find something. I just don't think that's going to happen. The inspectors didn't find anything and I
doubt that we will. The people going to find out the truth and
the truth will say that this intelligence is good intelligence there's doubt in my mind. What will do is find the people who will tell
us. There a lot of people who lie and get away
with it and that's just a fact. He had not developed any significant capability
with respect to weapons of mass destruction. He is unable to project conventional power
against his neighbors. We are able to keep arms from him. His military forces have not been rebuilt. Is U.S. credibility on the line of weapons
of mass destruction in Iraq? I'm not exactly sure what that means. Depends on the assumptions, it depends on
how long the war lasts, it depends on where the weapons of mass destruction are used. What we have done is we have taken estimates
looking at different variables and said if this were the case on this variable and lynched
on this variable but there's so many variables that the numbers of possible point answers
create a range that simply isn't useful. I'm just not going to get into any speculation
about numbers. We're dealing with a country that can really
finance its own reconstruction and relatively simply. So, the money is going to come from Iraqi
oil revenue as everyone has said. The think it's going to be something like
2 billion dollars this year. They think it might be something like 15-12
next year. They think it might be something like 18 to
20 plus the next 19. Nineteen. The next year. I will soon submit to congress a request for
87 billion dollars. Why did the administration so dramatically
underestimate the cost of this war? We did not have perfect foresight into what
we we're going to find in Iraq. With the cost of the war rising and the search
for weapons of mass destruction going nowhere, the administration turns to David Kay. This work is being carried out under the direction
of Dr. David Kay a respected scientist and former U.N. Inspector who is leading the weapon
search in Iraq. We are determined to take this apart. We have a tremendous group of dedicated American
men and women involved in this with the best assets of the Intelligence Community and provide. Dr. Kay and his team are making progress. We have had found a large body of continuing
activities and a equipment. We are surprised by new advances that we're
making. Network with laboratories and safe houses
controlled by Iraqi Intelligence and security services. And unlike prewar intelligence, we don't require
someone just to say something, we actually need the physical evidence. Equipment suitable for continuing chemical
and biological weapons research. David Kay is not going to be done with this
for quite some time. David Kay wants more time. And he says it can take another 6 to 9 months
to makes a definitive finding. Administration is asking congress for hundreds
of millions more. Six hundred million dollars to fund the continuing
search. We have not yet found shiny, pointy things
that I would call a weapon. Before we can draw firm conclusions we need
to let the Iraq survey group complete it's work. We were all wrong probably in my judgment
and that is most disturbing. It's inevitable that there will be an outside
commission appointed on an issue of this gravity. We'll have public hearings and we will get
to the bottom of this and we will let the chips fall where they may. Democracy you have an obligation. Your obligation is to speak truthfully to
the public. That's the basis of civility and our belief
in our system of government. It is going to require outside effort probably
through an outside commission to deal with some of these very serious problems. Cause I think explanations are important in
a democracy. This whole episode has caught the White House
completely by surprise. They've become so fearful of admitting error
that they stand up and defend things that, on their face, a face are untruthful. President Bush is being pounded with calls
for an independent investigation into how U.S. Intelligence so badly misjudged Iraq's
capabilities before the war. Having your president holding all the cards,
appointing all the people, having everybody accountable to him is a very bad idea. If you say you're going to war because he
has weapons of mass destruction and you don't find those weapons, it is not persuasive to
jump to a second argument, well that didn't work but here I've got a second explanation,
I was asked if I would care to try to operationalize some of the comments I made about what was
going wrong in Iraq and so I said if you, among other things, that if you're going to
do this you had to treat it like an intelligence problem and that is not go looking for hidden
weapons but going and looking for the people who would be associated with hidden weapons. Well, what I did is I formed teams for each
of the areas and we formally had hypotheses. Half the teams took a hypothesis that it was
there, the other half said it wasn't there and both followed exactly the same method. If you believe it's there, what is the proof
that we'll in fact conform that, prove that hypothesis or what evidence clashes with it. The same thing is true with the teams that
took the hypothesis it wasn't there, is you know, collecting evidence, so yeah you start
with a viewpoint a hypothesis an academic would say and you collect the evidence that
will support or challenge. You tell them, you know, go form and discuss
with your team a hypothesis and get a strategy for doing it and I just, you know, I was unsure
whether they would come back pro or con and I really didn't care and that was intentional
because I didn't want to be seen as stacking the deck and we met every Saturday afternoon
and each team went through a very, almost it was rigorous but almost predictable. You started with here's our hypothesis, here's
what we've done this week, here's how the evidence stacks, here's what we propose to
do the next week and there would be a discussion between the groups and myself over, on each
of them of what they were doing a lot of cross-fertilization. There is a gradual buildup of evidence that
forces you challenge your preexisting belief and it keeps generating either more questions
or generates questions about the hypothesis. For example, I'll give you a real case. One of the first things that worried me was
we had a big army running through Iraq in March and April, WMD was not used against
them nor was it found. That's sort of remarkable if they had large
stockpiles. I really believe in the jungle telegraph,
put the word out on the street. Let people know what your about and what you
have to offer and usually you'll get people coming to you and I had a lot of money, reward
money and I had green cards or passports to virtually any attractive place in the world. You come to us with weapons of mass destruction,
evidence about the weapons and we'll take care of you. All I had coming to me were fabricators, people
who said it but didn't have anything, had absolutely no evidence. Iraq was a horrible place in June, July, August,
September, October, November, insecurity, the economy wasn't working, there was violence,
there's still violence there. It was remarkable to me and disturbing that
in a place this bad who wouldn't want to golden life boat to get out? All they had to do was come with information. I would protect their identity. It was clear to everyone I would take their
whole family. It wasn't a case you have to leave your family
behind, you'll be taken care of but you'll have to find a new family in California, well
some of them might have liked to, but no one bought and so that worried me. Around a weapons program if a weapons program
exists, you're going to find people, people engaged in the production, the technology,
engineering, design; people involved in protecting the weapons, people involved in moving them
and people involved in preparing to use the weapons. We found none of that. We were running into fewer and fewer leads
that looked profitable and a lot of evidence that stacked up to explain something other
than large stockpiles of weapons. I had the habit of writing a personal report
back every weekend which was quite separate than the official reports back saying, you
know, this is what it looks, smells like to me. Here are the issues of the week. Here's how I'm proposing just to, I've always
found that's a good way to keep people informed of what you're doing. I don't think there was a surprise about the
conclusions I was drawing because those were fully, and I think completely and adequately
reported. I think the surprise would be that you would
speak out and say that. I had the privilege, although I didn't always
think it was a privilege, of watching a lot of very senior government officials come to
agonizing terms about Vietnam and decide not to speak out because they knew they'd never
be asked to lunch again. They wouldn't be part of the process and I
just, I think like a lot of people of my age and my generation who were in the government
by no means unique to me just decided that if ever the occasion came, I simply wasn't
going to live like that. There wasn't a lunch or part of process that
was important enough. This committee has a special responsibility
to the men and women of our Armed Forces to look at the prewar intelligence because planning
for military operations is based on intelligence. Policy makers take data, they interpret threat,
they assess risk. You talk about a mushroom cloud, how much
more imminent threat could there be? Why was there skepticism left out of the public
white paper of the CIA? Many of us feel that the evidence so far leads
only to one conclusion, that what has happened was more than a failure of intelligence. It was the result of manipulation of the intelligence
to justify the decision to go to war. Secret societies have their own rules and
secret societies generally don't feel an obligation to openly and democratically communicate. Prime Minister Blair has setup a similar commission
in Great Britain. Yeah. His is going to report back in July. Right. Ours are not going to be until March of 2005,
5 months after the presidential election. Yeah. Shouldn't the American people have the benefit
of the commission before the election? Well, the reason why we gave it time is cause
we didn't want it to be hurried. This is a strategic look, kind of a big picture
look about the intelligence gathering capacities of the United States of America. I think every president should have kept on
their desk the statement, the carved statement that Harry Truman had, ""The Buck Stops Here."" >> If there are no weapons of mass destruction,
which there aren't, if there are no ties with Al-Qaeda, which there weren't and which there
aren't or maybe now there are, then why did we go war? Well, all you need to do is go on the web
and download Project for a New American Century, there you find the ideological and the strategic
underpinnings for this policy which was rejected by George Bush the first which was ridiculed
out of town in those days but became the devout policy of this government and was implemented
starting with the war. I felt in my last year in the Pentagon that
I felt there was a great deal of contempt for the constraints on government that our
constitution lays out and I also felt that there was a contempt for the constitution
and I only absorbed this sense of contempt by association with some of these senior appointed
civilians. Who were all neoconservative, who all believe
in dominance, who believe in preemption, who believe in the military option as the first
resort rather than the last resort. They have had a very fixed indeed almost obsessive
idea that in fact Iraq is a major actor in the world and a probable threat, possibly
a deadly threat to the United States. This is group of people who have essentially
believed that might makes right, that the United States at this stage of history has
unchallengeable power and therefore our responsibility to use it to make the world over in the manner
that we or they how they think it ought to be made over. I think behind the basic neoconservative philosophy
is a considerable arrogance that American interest are the primary goal of all of American
foreign policy. And they seem to have a really serious habit
of not being interested in listening to what other people say about this subject. Now of course American interest should matter
but there are enlightened and unenlightened elements of self-interest and I think in this
case we have determined and defined our interest globally in almost total disregard of what
others states want, what their concerns are, how they might or might not be able to contribute. It's we're on a roll, you're either with us
or get out of the way; I find remarkably little interest in the character of other countries,
the nature of their problems and difficulties. This is boring I think to neoconservatives
who really see this as quite irrelevant what other people, what the political culture of
other societies are, what they want, what their people might want, what some their concerns
might be. It's really quite irrelevant because we know
what we're going to do and get out of the way if you don't agree. They said, look the neocons, we brought down
the evil empire of the Soviet Union and now we're going to bring down Arab nationalism
as personified by Saddam Hussein and Bashar al-Assad and once that happens you're going
to have democracy. You know, the problem is those people have
not set foot, if they've been to the Middle East it's been to Tel Aviv only. No, I don't think it's an accident at all
that so much of the justification turned out to be fallacious, misleading deliberately
so. They thought they had a place in history. They we're going to bring down obviously a
very dysfunctional Arab peninsula, as well as, Iran and they we're going to change history. They believed they won the Cold War and they
said, alright we won the Cold War because we were tough with the Soviet Union, we get
tough with these people and they're going to become like us. It is fair to say that the Iraq War was a
diversion from the war on terrorism. It certainly meant the people weren't paying
as much attention to Afghanistan as they should have and the resources that might have gone
to Afghanistan ended up being focused more in Iraq. If you attack another country with no justification,
people are going to say wait a minute this isn't a war on terrorism, this is a war on
imperialism, this is colonialism, you know, and this is why it's a distraction because
you need the help of these people. You get this view that the CIA and FBI are
lurking around the [inaudible] in the Middle East and handcuffing people or assassinating,
it just doesn't [inaudible] work. You got to have the help of the locals to
identify these people and either put them in jail or remove them from positions where
they can do harm. In January of 2002, as I was sitting in the
bunker of the U.S. Embassy in Cobble, Afghanistan and I and several colleagues were sitting
around one little working TV and low and behold here came the infamous statement of the access
of evil, Iraq, Iran and North Korea and we all looked at ourselves and went, oh my God,
you know, here we are kind of in ground zero of Afghanistan and Washington's talking about
and talking in very belligerent terms about these other 3 countries and we don't have
Afghanistan anywhere close to being settled. The only person Saddam was a threat to at
this point as we saw when the army collapsed, was to Iraq. He didn't have weapons of mass destruction. He wasn't scaring anybody. He certainly wasn't scaring the Iranians or
the Turks or the Saudis or anybody else. It was a state that was on the verge of failure,
now it is a failed state. Failed states cause terrorism, you know, you
can name them Afghanistan, Lebanon, Somalia. Anytime you create a vacuum it's where people
flock to discontented to fight wars. Osama bin Laden had been saying for years,
America wants to invade an Arab country and occupy it, an oil rich Arab country; he had
been saying this, this was part of his propaganda. So, what we do after 9/11? We invade an oil rich and occupy an oil rich
Arab country which was doing nothing to threaten us. The only real connection is that having invaded
Iraq we are very likely to make it a focus of terrorism. We are likely to produce what the president
has said Iraq represents, namely the central battle field in the war on terrorism. Why? Because we sent a lot of Americans into a
place where they're sitting ducks for people who think the only good American is a dead
one. Iraq cannot be govern by Americans, I don't
care what the intention is. I don't care if we truly wanted to build a
democracy. It cannot be ruled by foreign power. We as the one indispensable nation of the
world as we characterize ourselves for so long in the last administration cannot contemplate
that possibly someone else might not like everything we call the American way of life
and that they would in fact welcome us into their countries. This may not be the case. The only tool in the toolbox, the Bush Administration
is military force. Military force is a very blunt instrument,
it just doesn't work. We've created more terrorists in Iraq and
we haven't even solved the problem in Afghanistan. One of the more ironic effects of the attack
on Iraq was to buttress other countries in the conviction of the infamous remark by an
Indian General after the first Gulf War when he said. ""The lesson was war, is that if you have to
fight the United States you better have nuclear weapons."" In some respects, it's as Vietnam didn't even
happen. It's as if a lot of our leaders have suffered
some kind of historical and political lobotomy and that's frightening and every American
should be concerned about that because the United States ultimately is supposed to an
exemplar for the rest of the world. We are supposed to be in Ronald Reagan's words
""That shine city on a hill"" well that shining city is looking kind of slummy right now in
terms of our image abroad and I think with good reason. We violated I think fundamental principles
that have guided this country's foreign policy so successfully since 1947. You don't want your president to be seen as
a hotdog and when your president gets into a jumpsuit and gets in the back of a jet and
lands on an aircraft carrier and then waddles out with his little straps between his legs
and that's not, I mean you want a sign of kind of maturity and not testosterone blasting
through when you're talking about things so fundamentally important as sending a nation
to war and sending young men and women to their deaths. There is a sense in Washington now that you
can't raise objections to this because you're not supporting the troops in the field. I would rapidly point out that unlike almost
anybody I know that hold office in this country, I've had 2 sons in uniform both of whom have
been in combat and so I don't have to take any nonsense from anybody nor will I. Mark Twain's definition of patriotism he says,
""Patriotism is supporting your country all the time and your government when it deserves
it."" Well, I don't think it's patriotic to standby
and remain silent while your country stumbles into disaster. A patriotism is the last refuge of scoundrels
and I think these are scoundrels. They have no argument now. They have no defense for what they did. The country is in a terrible international
security situation that I think is perilous, so they're attacking the patriotism of others. Having been an insider, I know that the insiders
don't have it all right. They make mistakes, indeed [inaudible] and
there's more likely to be misjudgment if there is no criticism. It was Jefferson who said that our kind of
government is not based on trust, it's based in fact suspicion. Supporting the constitution, understanding
what's in the constitution, carrying about the constitution that's why we don't have
a king cause we have a piece of paper, so I think, I think that is a patriotism. It's not just those of us who have been privileged
to serve actually in the government who are the patriots, it's every citizen who respects
and honors the fact that we have such a wonderful country. To suggest that if you have a different viewpoint
than any given administration and/or if you're not supporting the president in policies that
may be highly erroneous. I don't see that as patriotism at all, in
fact, I would argue that any patriot with integrity is going to speak out if he or she
feels that we're on the wrong course. It's not unpatriotic to demand that congress
upholds the constitutional responsibilities regarding the declaration of war, it's not
unpatriotic to be very upset, vocally upset when congress abrogates this constitutional
responsibility be transferring war powers of 40 to the President of the United States
as they did in October of 2002. Listen, when you guys were working NASDAQ.coms
I was out in Iraq trying to get of Saddam and almost got killed for it and besides almost
going to jail, so it doesn't take a whole lot of courage for me to come out against
the war and I did at the beginning but I was studiously ignored. When we did the first Gulf War when I came
of Bagdad in 1991, I met with the President of the United States, I met with the senior
leadership of both parties and the one thing that sticks with me to this day is the extent
to which each one of them explained to me in very emotional terms the extent to which
they had to plum their consciences to come to a decision on how to vote on the use of
force authorization. It had been a moral decision on their part. It had been one that had kept them up at night
as they thought their way through this. We owe our soldiers, our sailors, our airmen
and our marines nothing less before we send them to battle. Sometimes the true patriot takes the unpopular
course but helps their country avoid mistakes and even if they can't persuade at least they
tried. For me, America is this amazing land of opportunity,
beauty of idealism, of hope. It is a beacon to the world. It's a place of fantastic people and what
infuriates me more than anything else is that this administration has systematically slandered,
labeled, blackened the image of America to our friends and allies round the world. Having the authority and the ability to go
and wage war is a very, very solemn thing and it needs to be done with care and with
deliberation and with genuine forethought and I think that none of that was present
in the lead up this entire debacle that we now call enduring freedom. When the emperor has no clothes you have to
have the presence of mind and the courage to stand up and say, ""The emperor has no clothes."" The regime is seeking a nuclear bomb. He has attempted to purchase high-strength
aluminum tubes suitable for nuclear weapons production. Material sufficient to produce more than 38,000
liters of botulin toxin. Saddam Hussein had an advanced Nuclear Weapons
Development program. The British Government has learned that Saddam
Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa. Already, the Kay report identified dozens
of weapons of mass destruction related program activities. ",3
QXD8V3Guh9I,9/11 was an inside job hello my friends my name is Otto today and I'm an Estonian youtuber today I'm here with Yvonne I'm from the US and from Michigan what are we gonna talk about today today is September 10th and tomorrow is September 11th I'm not really sure what someone from Estonia would think about 9/11 or what anyone outside the US really thinks so I'm kind of curious okay so how old are you on the date of 9/11 I was five years old I was a baby I'd remember seeing it on the TV I thought it's like a movie or something and I took it as like a computer game or a fun fund I didn't much care and people move there really quickly in Estonia two days later no one even talked about it anymore so it happened a little bit of shock and then people moved on and it was forgotten I'm sure it's much different in America yeah I think people still I mean every day that the date of the 9/11 comes up I know myself when I see that it's 9/11 if I don't watch the news I'm not paying paying attention to what day it is and I don't see any Memorial stuff or anything like that if I get in bed and I noticed you know what the date is I'll at least you know do some research and kind of take a moment out of my time to go back through and remember the day and remember what happened when 9/11 happened I have no recollection I was four I don't know what the date was like at all I don't know where I was I don't know what I was doing for as young we were both loved children like small children what happened yeah I just have what's on the internet now I don't have any actual attachment or a feeling of that day seeing the footage and seeing like listening the phone calls and reading the facts in the news it's all really chilling even when you are that young and you and you have no attachment to it going back to through all of that stuff as an impact on you we were both children we were a separate part of the worlds opposite part of the world how many people died that over 2000 I think that's a lot of people more faces that one would remember they all had children mothers fathers and why who did 9/11 I've done a lot of research on every time the date comes I'm on YouTube and I find myself in an endless loop of videos and of course you're coming across some conspiracy videos at that point some of the stuff is really really provoking it's it's really thought-provoking and it gets you thinking I don't want to believe that it was been spent seriously I don't want to believe that our government or anyone planned it and framed a terrorist group but it seems like more and more of that information is surfacing or or more and more people are starting to believe that I think people don't want to believe it I mean who wants to believe their own government lying to them or whatever because their security would be shot to hell right 9/11 was an inside job what I mean by that is people deliberately made that dissin decision for that to happen and they knew what's what's gonna come out of it and what will they gain from it a small group of people made it happen very powerful very rich people they gained a lot from it I'm not saying America gained or some terrorist organization I think those people might not care about ideology as much as control or money after 9/11 it's much harder for foreign people to get into our country even for a vacation and it's ten times harder than it was to become a citizen of this country now as a foreigner just because of that day also our army was heavily funded after 9/11 would you say all war would stop on earth and all armed conflict conflict on earth would stop right now would it be good or back to United States I think would be bad we have a lot of friends because we're so strong and for that solely and not only because of our economy our army plays a big factor and where our puzzle piece fits in the world some people who are high up trying to keep that intact to try to keep our army there and try to keep us powerful because everybody wants to be friends with the strongest in the world I don't think that's a good thing that that we had that reputation it's so crazy that after 9/11 I remember also as stolen security is such a small country with no danger to terrorism airports weren't so strict and so time-consuming the process to get through the borders it was much hardened after 9/11 all this warmer sea life started to liven up after 9/11 now we have American troops in our country which is a good and a bad thing 9/11 as as something that happened on American soil affects the whole world that is crazy a lot of people say that Bush did it I don't think that Bush did 9/11 George Bush was just a puppet whether he was aware or not I don't think he could have changed the outcome but I think he knew it was going on but maybe yeah you couldn't change it like after 9/11 CIA and everyone they started listening to everyone's conversation oh yeah yeah you you send you send anything into a chat or out on your Facebook or something like that especially if you're someone who's well known all right I mean anything well to some of the video up I have one more question for you what do you think people should be doing on 9/11 read the news and watch the videos just remember the day keep yourself open thank you so much for watching this video if you want to see one on the channel again write in the comments because I read every last comment and if a common comes and get like put more reborn into channel then we're gonna be making a lot of more videos and two floors above himself yeah knock on my door whenever he wants or the ceiling with the roof yeah if you're new to my channel and consider subscribing with I post videos every day thank you so much for watching and until my next video stay cool and bye bye ,2

GHEbNLvQ_MY,welcome everyone thanks for tuning in today i have a special guest who many viewers have been requesting my guest is the executive director of the post sustainability institute she's also a retired forensic commercial real estate advisor specializing in imminent domain valuation she served as a district branch chief of the for the california department of transportation for nearly 30 years her career in litigation support on land use has culminated in exposing the impacts of sustainable development on private property rights and individual liberty rosa quarry is an author and a public speaker who has spoken across the world you can find her work on our website democrats against unagenda21.com very happy to welcome the author of behind the green mask un agenda 21 rosa quarry miss corey thank you for taking the time to be here today my pleasure now you were considered to be a top expert on agenda 21 and your work has been invaluable in bringing this un agenda to light now for those of you the viewers out there who may not exactly know what agenda 21 is could you please provide us a brief overview of this program sure objective 21 is the action plan it's the blueprint the comprehensive plan that was signed on to by 178 nations plus the holy see in 1992 it's the united nations plan and uh it's a plan to inventory and control all land water plants minerals construction means of production food energy everything on the planet law enforcement education and of course information and human beings so uh this is you know a comprehensive plan of action an inventory and control plan it's about data sharing it's about uh money transferring from the developed nations to the lesser developed nations and ultimately it's about destroying uh your ability to have a voice destroying your ability to have representative government it's about changing your government to governance and taking away your voice giving your uh your you know entirely destroying your ability to be free and to be independent and the goal of course is to transfer power from uh local and uh individuals to a global governance system so you can't do that all at once and it's been a long process and you see it as uh you know exactly what you're seeing right now it's a plan to disrupt and destroy the existing system it's a plan of transformation and control and that's what we're living through right now i would have to agree that it is absolutely taking place right now and many people may not be very familiar with agenda 21 despite the fact that this has been around for some time and it's taking place right now but i would say that maybe more people might be more familiar for example with the un 2030 agenda for sustainable development because we've seen all the celebrities championing this and and uh you know both of these programs are u.n programs what is the difference if any between agenda 21 and the 2030 agenda agenda 21 is the agenda for the 21st century and of course you know that the century is 100 years long and so agenda 2030 is a 30-year milestone within the agenda 21 plan so i really think this is a public relations uh sort of end game around those of us who've been really alerting the public to agenda 21 because now that they're saying well agenda 21 has been replaced by agenda 2030. there's so much great information out there about agenda 21 that uh they're trying to divert you from focusing on agenda 21. now if you know when you know that agenda 2030 is simply a milestone year within that hundred year period the milestone years are agenda are 2020 2025 2030 and 2050. they really fully expect to have this entire plan locked up and completed by 2050. if you go to america2050.org which is a ford foundation and rockefeller foundation project you'll get a look at what their idea is for uh for in fact what they want the united states to uh devolve into which is to destroy the the sense of having a unified uh union and to in fact not have 50 states any longer to have 11 mega regions and in fact what this plan does is it destroys the um the the actual the concept of the nation state and it completely destroys it and devolves it into the city-states or regions and these are not you know like individual cities like say san francisco or new york these are uh regions that are uh governed by mega cities which are huge enormous cities it could be part of washington state part of oregon part of idaho and part of british columbia so it breaks the national borders it breaks state borders breaks of course county and city borders and this is about destroying your ability to uh to actually be able to control what it is that happens to you it's a plan that is actually it's a global plan but they implement it locally so it looks like a local plan it's always called different things no matter where you live so that's another way of being a stealth plan you see is that you'll never see it called agenda 21. it's always called something else and it's right there in your town it's a regional plan and it's right there where you live right now and typically uh they do call it some type of sustainable development uh or at least to try to a green new something uh you know it's for the the betterment of you know mankind of course and they always try to seem it seems like they're packaging this agenda around the the climate initiative uh you know like the global first it was global warming then it's global cooling now it's just climate change and so what is your take really on you know the the climate crisis in general is there a real uh man-made climate change issue that is gonna wipe out humanity if we don't obey and follow their new uh paradigm of global governance or is that just being used as a front to usher in this new system yeah let me just say uh since i i think i haven't mentioned this is that sustainable development is agenda 21. um it was defined by the united nations in a book that they commissioned called our common future in 1987. so sustainable development of course everybody thinks it's you know it's so good it's got those buzzwords it sounds so cool and uh so as far as climate change goes um you know as i say if they could have arranged a an alien landing you know they would have done that because um you know and of course covet 19 this is uh you know this is a way to well here's a way to think of it uh global crisis um requires a global response and that justifies global governance so what's you know what could be more global you think than uh climate change well how about a pandemic so this is you know kind of the way that uh and the other thing is that it's a it's designed to panic people it's designed to engage you in a in a really visceral way to frighten you to the point where you are literally concerned that you will not survive and uh of course kova 19 takes it you know to the next level but um you know that's the purpose of this thing whether there's actually you know of course the climate is always changing certainly uh but whether you know whether this is you know something imminent or whatever it's irrelevant actually because the thing is so powerful and so useful that it would have been invented regardless now miss corey i'm sure that you have seen the world economic forum come out recently and announced their great reset initiative coupled with the fourth industrial revolution now what was your initial reaction to seeing them come out and boldly proclaim that we need this great reset uh because of this this series of crisis that we have taking place because it seems like as of the beginning of 2020 they have really accelerated their agenda uh what does the great reset mean in your view and what stage of the rollout are we in would you say well i have to say i've been really uh concerned and saddened in a deep sense uh to see this because i really thought we had more time and i don't want to be a person who's an alarmist i think this is really a very serious moment that we're in this is one reason why i called my book behind the green mask because they stay behind that green mask they don't want to take that mask off because once the mask is off you know then the boots and the and the jack boots and the you know the trenches come out and i guess i'm concerned mainly because it looks like we're really getting to that point and uh the other thing that happens when they reveal their plans quite you know the plans are always uh right out there you know they've always been right out there in fact you could go back to the 1880s and look at the fabian socialists at uh bertrand russell h.g wells at uh george bernard shaw uh and you'll see the plan is right there uh there's no question about it and it's just been they've been refining it with the ability that they're getting with technology and i think that is really where we're at now is that they're less concerned about us they're less concerned about our uh our objection and that is what concerns me is that uh the less concerned they are it's it's sort of a message to us that yeah we're not really uh you know we're not really concerned to them so therefore you know it makes me think you know maybe we're at that point where there's not much we can do but i think really there is still a lot that we can do and i do want to talk about that but what what is happening now is that the technology has caught up to the plans of these people they've always had these same plans and i will say that as far as technology goes what has man always wanted man has always wanted two main things to live forever and to create life and we are very close to these things i don't know about forever but we're close to major life extension and the creation of life all you have to do is go to uh cornell university's plan uh they've got a a video out right now it's engineers create three major traits of life go and take a look at that they are actually creating life so and there is no ethical uh stop on these people and that is a major concern this is you know what you saw with the nazis with this with stalin with now that there is literally nothing that holds these people back so when they have the technological ability and you know you look at the fourth industrial revolution or whatever it is they want to call it they're talking about total digital connectivity they're talking about a new social contract well you know i don't know about you but a contract generally means that both parties have you know something to say about it but this is a contract where you know none of us have anything to say and i think we're getting to see what it looks like when you go out in the street you see and this is one reason why this is all you know we can talk about this when we get more deeply into it but this is one reason why you're seeing this kind of hysteria in the street because it's a lesson and uh it is a notification to us this is what's going to happen to you if you go out into the street and try and object to this plan when you see what it really is so they are gearing up for this with the militarization of police etc now you mentioned earlier about you know the us for example and in order for this agenda to succeed uh the us and the constitution it appears would have to be either severely altered or eliminated uh for this to be successful now in light of that what do you make of these events that we're seeing unfold right now with the coronavirus that we mentioned earlier and the civil unrest with the antifa and black lives matter taking to the streets and taking over entire portions of cities at this point like we see in seattle and they're attempting to do in portland is this an organized effort to destabilize and overthrow the us because it sure feels like it at this point yeah and i you know i want to say uh you know most of us think that the uh constitution of the united states is a great document and is in violet that is not the case right now uh there's been a real effort for many years to uh have a constitutional convention you're probably aware of that uh it needs um i it's i can't recall the exact number of states i think it's 38 states to uh to agree to it and once and they say that you know they're they're not going to uh you know they're just going to look at a couple of you know a couple of portions of the constitution but once that box has been opened they can do anything so you know people often want to know well who's doing it to me it is your government that's doing it to you your government has been taken over and to answer your question yes this is an insurrection it is uh you know it's being we have been under attack i hate to say this you know hey i've identified as a so-called liberal uh democrat you know since i started you know before i could vote uh and all of that you know it sounds like a conservative position i don't know what it is it's it's real this is a real situation that we're in um of course i i do want to say i did walk away from the democrat party but um you know and parties are are simply a distraction at the top power knows no party well the globalist uh takeover is simply that it uses whatever uh means necessary and so uh the plan is really to you know this term disrupt that everyone's seeing now this is really the plan is to destroy the social pro this social fabric it's quite successful as you're seeing it right now and yes the united states is a huge economic force and a huge force and beacon to the world for uh individual rights and freedom liberty which is under attack definitely and it is a target there is no question about that so um you know yes i i do think we're in an extremely dangerous situation right now and part of the reason why it is so dangerous is because it is supported by civil society by um by universities by foundations by business organizations by a public sector agencies this is a plan for governance and so all of those parties who have been of course indoctrinated since you know for the entire time that they were in university and prior you know pre-kindergarten to post-graduate school this is designed to utilize to activate those change agents that's really what the word change is really about it is an activation of agents for change and that is not a positive thing for the uh for the union of the united states it really is uh incredible to see all of these mega corporations like for example amazon and and countless others really throwing their support behind this uh this situation this what is it you know unfolding before our eyes uh all the celebrities i mean it the a lot of politicians everyone is really throwing their support behind this and you know we're seeing the police departments being defunded and in some cases dismantled and and now today uh the united nations a u.n panel has demanded that the u.s take immediate action to eliminate structural racism in the police system this is what the u.n panel is saying and we've seen uh george floyd's family petition the united nations to disarm the police here in the u.s to have the u.n disarm u.s police which is unbelievable to me um you know and we know that floyd was killed by the police he wasn't shot by the police but yet they're calling for disarmament now i can't help but think that this is playing right into a pre-planned agenda as everything lines up maybe something like the strong cities network i mean what is your take on defunding the police and uh what would be their alternative to the police yeah well this is so fascinating and it's you know i mean if you weren't uh living it it would just be such an interesting little uh thriller to be watching um you know because this is really about community oriented policing which uh is the panopticon which makes you the cop on the beat you are responsible for keeping your eyes on everything and reporting see something say something and uh you know of course uh they're talking about transformative new model of public of public policing or something like that of public safety i think they call it and whenever you see that term transform i want you to know transform is a term that's used it's a jargon term and it's used it's an agenda 21 term so transformative learning when you see it in the educational system you're going to see it in your policing system is really about you're not going to believe this or you probably will it's about breaking down the individual it's about breaking down your alliance to any old system any old connection your family your old thoughts your belief system it's literally makes you into a patient this is a mental health uh technique that destroys your it actually breaks you down it's a breakdown and then build back up of the personality and this is what they intend to do with police officers so in other words this whole you know institutional racism is a it's merely a um an excuse to destroy literally the minds you know mal used it uh mao mao zetang used this uh of course it was used by song it's used by the nazis it's a technique that's used to break down your personality and actually rebuild you as the new man and you are going to be rebuilt as the new global citizen so your police force will be rebuilt as people who literally uh cannot put their hand on their gun and you know what i can see happening here is that uh you know i i happen to be in mexico right now and this is a country that is run by the cartels uh literally you saw this when uh lopez uh uh obreedor uh just uh you know basically let el chapo's son go you know he said well hey i you know he they probably threatened his life the uh the cartels have more power than the uh government okay so what happens in a in a country like the united states where they don't really quite yet then you have militarization of the police or you have replacement of the police force with your full uh intelligence community and uh and military force and this is dangerous this is going to be dangerous the other thing is and i want to talk about this is artificial intelligence of course we need to talk about that um you know what's happening uh uh whether in your virtual and physical life and uh so when you have a police forces make made up of non-humans then uh you know which is which is on you know it's coming and you have it with drones etc which are directed by humans but at a certain point they will not be then you're going to have a real dangerous situation obviously i don't have to lay it out for you where you're not able to reason with a human being and this in so this is actually a two-part plan you see it's a plan to destroy your existing police force on the ground who lives in your neighborhood probably and knows you and or or at least knows your area and then you're going to have you're going to be replacing that with with something very very different yeah it certainly is uh shocking how quickly this is rolling out it seems like they they pressed the initiate play button you know as soon as 2020 hit even though this has been a long standing agenda that as you pointed out has been incrementally taking place you know and conditioning the public to accept the coming transitions and and you know as you pointed out the ai absolutely you're absolutely right about ai police new zealand just recently launched the first ever ai police officer they have it right now in new zealand it's essentially a kiosk where you you can walk up and talk to and interact with and we've seen the the robots from boston dynamics and darpa and everything like that and they're already using some of these robots in singapore for example to enforce the social distances so this is just happening quickly they're they're conditioning us getting us ready for these transitions and you know you talk about how now they're basically they were waiting for the technology to catch up with their program and how agenda 21 is the inventory and control program of every aspect on life and and they're basically this transition we're transitioning into a new digitalized system where everything will be on the monitored and tracked and traced on the blockchain and everything will be essentially tokenized and so it really is like this this is a technocratic plan of a takeover operation that eisenhower warned us of you know on his farewell speech beware of the the scientific dictatorship essentially and here we are living it uh right now and and you know we always hear about uh you know when we see it it's an anti-human uh agenda essentially where they're looking to merge man with machine and and you know we always hear about the depopulation aspect of that you know how does how does that play into all of this as well in your view yeah i want to say you know basically when you have de facto martial law everyone is the enemy and that's what you have with kovid 19. everyone is the enemy you have no literally lost your trust for anyone even your closest family members so uh you know this is a way to break down society it's a way to break down mental health and this is also health is a very vital part of this plan because of course collecting your dna you know this is a plan to inventory and control everything including your dna the human genome project to be able to actually control life you can make life you can actually destroy life and going back to of course the uh you know 1880s and the fabian socialists the eugenics plan this is not something that went away this plan you know the idea that you can actually make the human race better and uh that you know and so consequently you're going to have to get rid of anyone who does not make the human race better and that of course ties in with your social credit score and uh whether you're worth it whether you have value and you know this has already been um you know happening in the university systems which are you know basically designed to search for anyone who does offer value and to offer them a free ride and uh you know in exchange for research and and then everyone else just pays and is indoctrinated and indebted uh so um this is you know the design of the system right now it's already doing that so yes that you know this is the way it's set up is that um whether you you know whether you're worth it or not uh is it's you know going to be determined through your you know your credit score and then all of this is you know technologically possible now so this is the design of the plan and uh yes it's you know so some people of course you know the sperm count is down and uh you know people have of course you know women have children later this is okay so when you're looking at the sustainable development goals all right um agenda 2030 has uh uh what is it 17 sustainable development goals uh in 2015 the uh millennium development goals there were eight millennium development goals uh this is you know it's a very i think it's a very chinese model if you look at the chinese model um you know to number things you know the thousand flowers all the you know they always number things so do is this a chinese plan no it's not but the chinese are certainly a part of this and did agree to agenda 21 and also agreed to uh work on a depopulation vaccine with the united states back in the 1990s so have they how far they proceeded with that we don't know so uh depopulation is of course a vital part of the plan because the plan moves you out of the rural and suburban areas into the dense city centers where you can be more easily managed controlled and surveilled and uh of course these cities are not capable of literally holding that many people so the design of the plan is to uh you know make it so that they can hold as many people as possible to you know increase the and i want to say that your buildings are very important to this plan smart cities the strong cities network all of this uh you know you can look at alphabet and their sidewalk labs which is uh quayside they were trying to do in toronto which was about um you know literally tracking every aspect of your life building a city from the ground up this is the goal to have to you are living within a panopticon that is the design of this plan is literally to take your freedom completely away from you and i'm not talking about some plan that's way out there in a you know in the future i am talking about this is happening right now and yes it's about depopulation because you know what you are just not worth it you use too much you are taking up too much room you're using to this is what uh you know this is what client the climate change thing is all about you are using too much energy too much water and too much land and you need to be isolated and moved into the high density city center where you can be more easily controlled and managed and surveilled and that is what this is doing to you right now so you know it's not like this plan is out there in 2030 or 2050 2020 is a really important year a lot of these plans when you look at your regional plan for your area a lot of these plans are named your town whatever the name is 2020 because 2020 is a key year in the implementation of this plan absolutely i have to agree with you on that and when we see you know people people obviously get very caught up in the divide and conquer tactics and strategies and we're so busy fighting about left or right or trump or whoever and uh you know and the same thing applies geopolitically as well it's like uh oh china's the bad guy or russia's the bad guy or whoever when as you pointed out these these countries have all signed on to the same game plan the same game plan for global governance and and these groups like the world economic forum have been uh deciding what the future of humanity looks like for you and for me and for us and it doesn't look very human at all and we have no say according to them at this point so this is extremely important information that is taking you know place right now and i would like to in today's discussion with possible solutions like what can people do uh you've had some success in this area of actually defeating agenda 21 in some areas what can you tell us about that and and what should people be doing right now to resist well i think you know this is my sort of my watch word is uh awareness is the first step in the resistance and action is the second step and i think it's i think it's really important that uh that people understand that we are being uh we're being we're being conditioned to be passive right now we're being conditioned to click alike and think that that means that we're a political activist and it does not mean that you are not a political activist if you don't leave your house um you need to leave your house and uh but the lockdowns but but the lack of that's right i know and plus your government has now gone virtual where uh you know you can't used to be now i know most of you don't even know where you're i don't need to insult you but let me insult you here you don't even know where your city council meets you think it doesn't matter but those are the people who make the rules that you live under right there in your town and you better believe it does matter and don't tell me that you're that your government is so bad that you know that you can't do anything about it that it sure looks like that but the thing is is that you've let it get that way and if you continue to let it get that way it ain't going to get better so what you need to do is actually occupy your government to you know to take a term that you know i think was really misused um to actually go and be a part be your government be your government if you can you know now yeah we're in the end game here there's not a lot of time left so you know you should have been doing this a while ago but the thing is is that you need to know what agenda 21 looks like and you need to recognize it so that when you see it in your city you can go and talk about it you can uh first of all get yourself elected you can run for office if and not get elected but talk about it you can stand you know up in your city council every single item on that agenda is probably related to agenda 21 if you know what you're looking for and you i actually tell you how to find that by you know you can look at my websites you can look at my book where i tell you how to actually take down their delphi meetings where they're manipulating public opinion so that you won't make trouble for them because really they don't want you to make trouble they're hoping that they don't have to bring out the cops so they're really wanting to you know keep you in your seat and keep you at home quiet so that's what you don't want to be is the person who sits at home so you want to take this on you want to spread this information you can do it with flyers you can do it with mailers you can spend a little money you can make some videos you can share them with people you can share these videos with people and then decide what kind of action you're going to take because just knowing without doing something about it is simply not enough at this time so you have to become more politically active and more willing to not be a first adopter of many of their stuff you're going to see virtual reality that's going to replace your reality it's going to be so much better you're going to be able to eat virtually uh do some pretty fun stuff if you get my meaning virtually and everybody's going to want to do it once you do that your life is over and uh so you're going gonna wanna uh you know you're going to want this stuff they're making it so that you want it so you're gonna ask for it you have to resist that resist it in yourself plus take a look at yourself what do you do for a living are you a change agent are you an organizational manager are you working for the city or the or the state or the feds or the county what are you doing are you part of this plan are you a planner are you part of this plan are you a university professor don't be like brett weinstein who up there in in uh evergreen college who you know all of a sudden he's like oh no they're attacking me it's like yeah dude what have you been doing all these years you've been teaching them this stuff you know if you are participating in this plan withdraw your support withdraw your financial support your political support and your social support have some guts because that's what it takes people aren't going to like you but you need to do it wherever you work wherever you are you need to talk about this if you're in a government meeting if you're in a if you're a manager at some supermarket you want to talk about this in your management meeting you talk about this everywhere tell people about this plant it is a real actual thing that is right there in your city right now on the shelf being enacted right now on you we don't have time now but if this agenda 21 is not like wikipedia tells you it's not an involuntary non-binding plan this is a plan that is binding on you it was brought into the united states 1992 and uh and the whole clue you know that you're gonna get is that the federal government enacted it so and it's gone down into the states and cities so it's a real plan it's really there in your town so you know what let's participate together let's fight this together we can do it we have had some successes but you know what we need more we have to fight this together all of us and resist well sid i mean it's taking place unfolding right now and i can't thank you enough for the great work that you're doing to help bring this to light i'd also like to thank all of the viewers out there who watch and share this information share these reports and and like miss corey said you know get out there get involved start attending some city council meetings listen to what these people are saying and if they are saying some things that you know ring uh sound off an alarm in your head maybe maybe you should speak up uh you know and let others in your communities know because this is i've been i've been all over this country i've been to several different countries around the world and i've seen it you see it taking place even through um you know like the federal government funding uh road maintenance in your towns it fall under some of the sustainable development programs i mean it is it is ingrained into every little aspect and they're selling it to better you know the world and the environment and and you know everything like that but this is an anti-human agenda that is taking place right now and this is a dark road that we do not want to continue down this road of tyranny in my view i encourage everyone to make your way over to rosa corey's websites democrats against un agenda 21 and the post sustainability institute i'll make sure i leave links to all of your social media accounts miss corey as as well as a link to your book behind the green mask un agenda 21 uh miss rosa corey thank you so much for being my guest today this is extremely important information and i i really respect the work that you're doing and to me it's people like you who are the real heroes it's not these celebrities out there or these athletes you know all this kind of garbage out there it's people like you who are making a difference who are doing things to affect real change do you have any final points you'd like to share miss rosa cory yeah i do want to say that we are all we all have to be heroes i'm just like everybody else we just all have to do it you've got to take it on and you know we can do it but we have to do it together united we can do it ladies and gentlemen miss rosa corey thank you so much thank you you ,3
BusdooE10vQ,"Beyonce taught us that girls run the world,
but sadly the queen bee is gravely mistaken. Throughout history power has always been concentrated
in the hands of the few- from the first tribal chieftains and their shamans, to today's political
elite. But sometimes that power has been held firmly
within bloodlines, passed down from generation to generation like a very unearned inheritance. Hello and welcome to another episode of The
Infographics Show- today we're taking a look at the most powerful families in the world. 5. Rothschild Family With a name that pops up in nearly every conspiracy
theory out there, it's no surprise that the Rothschilds would end up on this list. Whether they are responsible for assassinating
JFK to ensure he didn't invade Cuba and thus destroy the lucrative sugar market, to having
secretly financed 9/11 on behalf of the aliens from Zeti Reticuli so they could eat our brains-
if there's a conspiracy theory out there, chances are the Rothschilds are at the center
of it. With a family history such as the Rothschild's
though, it's hard to blame conspiracy theorists. Rising from a lowly apprentice working at
a small Hamburg bank, Mayer Rothschild displayed from an early age a keen interest and talent
for finances. In no time at all Mayer had made himself a
prominent member of the global banking industry, and would go on to install his five sons around
the financial capitals of Europe. Overseeing operations from London to Berlin,
the Rothschilds helped stabilize international currencies through their lending and banking
practices with individual governments. While this was generally a good thing as it
kept markets stable and people employed, the Rothschilds certainly earned a very pretty
penny for their 'charitable' work. As Europe plunged along the industrial revolution,
the Rothschilds were there to finance Europe's favorite hobby: waging horrible wars against
itself. Mostly staying on the right side of history
though, the Rothschilds were quick to lend England about 10 billion in today's dollars
to help finance the war effort against Napoleon Bonaparte. By this time the Rothschilds fortune was so
vast, and their financial network so elaborate, that they actually received the news of Napoleon's
defeat at Waterloo a full day before the British government! Such stunning displays of international power
and reach have for long time cast the Rothschilds under extreme suspicion, and they have throughout
history been blamed for pretty much every major war or other catastrophe, often portrayed
as nothing more than money-hungry and evil to the point of profiteering from human misery. The truth however is that the Rothschilds
were simply a family extraordinarily gifted in the world of finance, and their charitable
contributions to human society are some of the greatest in history and continue to this
day. Or perhaps the Rothschilds paid us to say
that so that you won't figure out they are secretly working for the Zeta Reticuli aliens
who definitely don't want to eat your brains. 4. Rockefeller Family If there's a name synonymous with the international
power and intrigue of the Rothschilds, it's the Rockefellers. John D. Rockefeller was born in rural New
York to a father who was a con man and a mother who was deeply religious. Unlike his shuckster father, John was often
described as a serious, polite, and honest young man, and at age 17 he began working
as a bookkeeper at a small produce firm. Working long hours, Rockefeller delighted
in the intricacies of the work, yet had a keen mind for finances and budgeting. Seeing an opportunity with the advent of the
internal combustion engine, Rockefeller started a business partnership with a friend and his
brothers, going into the business of refining oil at a time when everybody else was busy
trying to pump it out of the ground. The discovery of giant oil reserves in Texas,
and the growing exploitation of oil in the Middle East made it clear that this new resource
was the wave of the future, and yet very little infrastructure existed for the actual refining
of oil into fuel and other products. The oil ‘gold rush’ had seen entrepreneurs
open up prospecting and drilling companies around the world, but a growing need for oil
processing was being unmet. This is where Rockefeller and family came
into play. Founding Standard Oil in 1870, Rockefeller's
wealth exploded, and he would go on to end up controlling 90 percent of America's oil
pipelines and refineries. After his family's monopoly was broken up
by anti-trust laws in 1911, the Rockefellers continued to hold on to a large share of the
national oil production industry. At the time of this death in 1937, John D.
Rockefeller was valued at $340 billion in today's dollars, or four times more than Bill
Gates. However in the time since this record high,
a rise in international competition and lack of similar talent for finances by Rockefeller's
descendants has seen the family wealth plummet down to an estimated $11 billion, though somehow
we suspect that they get along just fine with only 11 billion dollars. 3. Morgan Family Born to a banker it's no surprise that John
Pierpont Morgan would follow in his father's footsteps and become a banker himself. However, unlike his father, John would go
on to found one of the world's most important financial institutions, J.P. Morgan & Company. During a scare in 1893 over the outflow of
the US's surplus gold to foreign nations, the US economy looked set to plummet- but
in these dire times John saw an opportunity that no others did. Putting together a syndicate of bankers which
included the Rothschilds, Morgan used US bonds to buy back gold from foreign investors, thus
restoring public faith in the dollar and stabilizing the economy. This gold and bond exchange however allowed
Morgan to effectively control the US gold supply, which let him finance the creation
of US Steel and General Electric while buying out all competitors- effectively taking over
two of the most important financial sectors of the entire nation: steel and electricity. Morgan’s control over the nation’s gold
supply at a time when the national economy- and most global economies as well- were tied
to the gold standard allowed Morgan to manipulate the economy to raise or lower the value of
the dollar and consumer prices. And despite ensuring a measure of fiscal responsibility,
this is overwhelmingly why the gold standard is a bad thing- no matter what your belligerently
libertarian uncle posts on your facebook wall every other week. Known as an unethical and cutthroat businessman,
Morgan bought out, bullied out, or outcompeted any competitors by slashing jobs, reducing
wages and generally doing away with anything even remotely related to workplace safety. If it wasn't generating money, it wasn't worth
his time- and after all the nation was full of peasants to replace those killed or maimed
in horrific industrial accidents. With no minimum wage laws or workplace safety
standards, Morgan effectively built an empire built on heaps and heaps of exploitation and
human misery- which by the way, is why minimum wage and workplace safety legislation are
important things to have. Sometimes government regulations are a good
thing to have, though we tend to forget that since we are so far separated from the misery
of the industrial revolution and its mass exploitation of the average worker. In modern times not much has changed, with
J.P. Morgan widely blamed for helping spread the practices of predatory lending which led
to the 2008 global financial crash. Rumors of the Morgan family being war profiteers
and generally banking on any human misery that will make them a single penny are popular-
and you know what, given the family's past, this time it's clear that if anybody is cooperating
with the aliens from Zeta Reticuli to eat your brains it's definitely the Morgans. Yet with such a commanding grip on the global
economy, there’s little the individual consumer can do to avoid engaging in a J.P. Morgan-backed
business. 2. DuPont Family Sired by a french immigrant who emigrated
into the United States in the 1800s, the DuPont family has built an empire based on manufacturing
and the distribution of industrial chemicals and military munitions. Initially establishing the family business
as a gunpowder manufacturer, DuPont quickly became the largest supplier of gunpowder to
the US military, and would go on to begin creating dynamite in industrial proportions. Like so many other monopolies, the DuPont
monopoly was broken up in the early 1900s under the Sherman Antitrust Act, but the family
still managed to maintain a huge market share of the global munitions industry, having supplied
nearly 40 percent of all the munitions used by Allied forces during the First World War. Unlike the Morgan family however, the DuPonts
felt at least some obligation to the nation they were profiting from, and so during World
War II when the US Government needed help producing plutonium for the war-ending Manhattan
Project, the DuPont company designed and built one of the largest plutonium plants in the
country, all the while keeping it an absolute secret to prevent the Axis powers from discovering
the US's research. In the 1950s after the Soviets exploded their
first atomic bomb, the DuPont company once more cooperated with the US government to
help America develop the hydrogen bomb, hoping to keep the US's edge over their Soviet competitors. Working hand-in-hand with the US government,
DuPont helped focus the efforts of the nation’s scientists, all the while being handsomely
compensated by the US government of course. The DuPonts may be the second most powerful
family in the world, but are surprisingly the subject of very few wild-eyed conspiracy
theories- except for one. Blamed for helping spur the US's prohibition
of hemp and cannabis in 1937 in order to protect its paper and nylon manufacturing, the DuPonts
have often been the target of those who see overly restrictive anti-marijuana laws as
unfair and needless. The widespread use of hemp as a manufacturing
product would after all cut into the DuPont’s earnings- yet if marijuana was legalized nationally,
there’s little doubt the DuPonts wouldn’t simply immediately engage in the growing and
processing of hemp products. And with their vast wealth to back their entrepreneurial
efforts, they would be doing so from a commanding lead versus any other competitor. 1. The Bush Family Best known for Presidents George W. Bush and
George Bush Senior, the Bush family began its climb to international power with Prescott
Sheldon Bush, a US banker and senator. For years the family was accused of hugely
profiting from World War II and for having established businesses with corporations that
financed Hitler's government, and the reveal of declassified documents in 2003 showed several
questionable transactions that could have been in violation of the Trading With The
Enemies Act. However after it was revealed in 1943 that
a Polish mining interest Prescott Bush was invested in was using forced labor from Auschwitz,
Bush distanced himself and engaged in the collection of funds for the victims of the
war. The rest of the Bush family hasn't escaped
scrutiny though, with both presidents having been blamed for profiting from the wars started
under their watch. These allegations may be a bit more of a stretch
than those against Prescott Bush however, as it's well known fact that George Bush Sr.
was very reluctant about starting a war against Iraq, and it was the consistent prodding from
Britain that finally spurred him to action. Whatever the case, having had two members
become presidents of the most powerful nation on earth has garnered the family international
prestige and connections, making them without a doubt the single most powerful family alive
today. Which of these families is truly the most
powerful in the world? How delicious exactly are your brains- we
have friends from out of town who are curious. Also, make sure you check out our other video

1nZZtKuWY5E,outer space the final frontier and the ultimate conspiracy theory flat earth don't groan I can hear this online community claims that 2000 years of scientific consensus that we live on a globe is a lie and that the earth is flat why do they think this and how can they prove it I wanted answers so I spoke to one of the leaders of the New Zealand Flat Earth movement Adrian and Morrison so what is the Flat Earth 3d that means that you do not believe that we'd love on a spelling giant ball of water that it's actually physically impossible do you believe 100% that flavour is true absolutely a hundred percent what you're sitting on here if true is one of the greatest breakthroughs in scientific history it's not a breakthrough it's it's what is because most people just realizing that because you're brainwashed people are losing the whole lives over this for speaking out are you in danger for doing speaking on the show I could possibly be do you have a gun no crossbow is the Beast why's crossbow the best silent it's almost terrifying Chevy where's my car be terrified you know being to God as part of your human nature but that doesn't bother me because the truth is more important than my life it's just such a big conspiracy that I can't a conspiracy theory at all it's fair okay you saying it's fact and you say you've got proof where's the proof if you could see the whole earth which you can't because of atmospheric got nothing else but Photoshop CGI and paintings but do you have Photoshop and cgo and paintings I feel like you guys don't even have that am i doing a bad job the interview oh I'm saying anything you don't want to hear no okay okay I was thinking it I'm sorry okay just let me be me okay okay I'll let you be you where'd you get this confidence wrong as you because we've got the evidence and the proof and everything but the other side says they've got the evidence and the proof as well well we're challenging them to find the curve they're challenging you to find the flat no it's our question they're the ones that says they're going into space why don't I makes sense and it's not right that people are being lied to and deceived just because they're evil and rich but who is deceiving us who is lying to us follow the money right back fifty two million dollars a day is given to these lawyers the Photoshop paintings and CGI well no starving in Africa there's no criminal trial that's what we're saying it's being tested that's being done and when it is no I'm living in an idiot instead of rebooting on how about I take you outside right now and absolutely prove to you that the moon is not a spherical solid ball if I'm excited this do it okay do the Sun damn what do you mean damn it's behind the clouds ah sometimes you see the whole moon you're saying that no one can answer this question cuz I'm sure a scientist could quickly answer their question I'm still questioning the moon we've got it are you a scientist yes I have a four year degree in Freddie's education from where from myself you gave it yourself look up every day in the sky there's certain days with the Sun and the moon will be very close together just don't look at the Sun because that will hurt your eyes will look at the moon well that's another thing they tell us that's correct we photosynthesize through our eyes nothing we're all looking at the Sun I dare you to look at the Sun right now I'm looking at the side I just don't know if I can trust you how do I trust you and not the people who are telling indoctrinating me well why don't you believe in me as a human being I want to be believed in I wanted to believe in Adrian but Judy clouds I wasn't convinced so I agreed to come to fix Bo a flat earth conference she was organizing featuring the star of the recent Netflix play earth documentary mark Sargent this was the biggest Flat Earth Expo in New Zealand history Flair's conviction hello yeah no no no no field hockey mate that's where it's at oh is the flat earthers I've gone to the wrong room I'd ended up at the flat turf Expo but two doors down I was opened up to a world of flat earth I don't know what's crazier your flat earth t-shirt or your Warriors shorts probably honest it's a wild ride supporting the worries so what are we on right now first yeah now I get it and what is it what shape is that flat with a dome over top with the cellular stars at the top yep see my cup of tea tells me it's flat because when I drink my cup of tea water goes back to where it should and the cup of tea it's round like this right it's it's sort of like a it's like a pizza and so when you sell around the world you get into the salami then you take a little turn to the chicken and you carry on around a bit further two different you know what I mean and the Scriptures say the scriptures you've got to go back to the book and the book I'm talking that's the Bible Jesus Christ all right we can't be going back to the Bible can we for like a scientific reasoning I'm not saying the Bible scientific concur I'm saying I take the Bible as little truth that sounds bad what sort of religion are you well I kind of got asked to leave yeah so I bet I'm on my own I'm forming my own sick now let you take my hand out okay can we get one now or afterwards well as I said they're in my bag and that in effect well I can but obviously there's more than one thing in there the more people I spoke to the more skeptical and frustrated I became it was unprofessional but when the time came from my big interview with Mark sergeant I just didn't give a anymore you're one of the biggest dick swingers in the flat earth game so no offense and when I said no offense it means you can't get offended by what I say I want this is the dumbest I've ever heard in my life yeah and your whole life is a lie I've heard that before I became a flat earther because I tried to disprove it or do you bunk it but do you not think the reason you can't debunk it is because you're a what yeah no I'm pretty clever problem-solver how do you prove the earth is flat by not finding the curve so Flat Earth is not something you can prove it's just something it's just you can disprove the realm go exactly it's bad these rules its lawyers rules the stars and the planets are just pretty pretty little lights Sun in the moon or just bigger lights like what is it an LED display uh probably little better than that okay this is ridiculous okay sorry sorry I don't mean to be it's okay you of you this can't even exist on its own it needs a solar system the Sun and galaxy around that and universe around the no one needs a  LED screen don't take my word for it do your own research ask some questions so you and a Netflix documentary yeah and how'd that go it went pretty well we shot bad bad okay I'm trying to put a positive spin on this turned out our biggest recruiting tool to date in fact a third of the 18 or 24 s we're on board with this and they also Paul which one people who died no the well Athena girl Mark had one good point it didn't matter what I said the more negative publicity they got the more the flat earth movement was growing I had to stop them I had to prove them wrong but first I had to thank Adrian for her lovely hospitality I don't know if I agree with everything you've said Adrian you're enough but I'm surprised that you put on such a good festival so well done thank you guy we're having a dinner tonight we're gonna celebrate I'm doing a few songs we could collaborate on something we could do like a debate rappy thing do it now I do a now I've been told since I was a child that the earth is round I agree with the science and I'd love all the rules and if you don't know that you don't deserve to be in school whoa but the earth is flat you see the horizon line 360 degrees just fine and you can see that you can't the moon I'll head up there her on see um so the int no I have something wrong with it finish it bring her home sorry ah well you do something an Ultron okay not too loud I'm coming at you with a round globe and if you do not love that then you are a snob to believe in science is a load of bull to believe in that you're just a lying fool learning filling my mind with knowledge yeah I love guns guns do this anymore did I win him he probably did I've spent the data Flair ethics bow and I was losing my mind there was only one way to prove that the earth was a globe I had to do an experiment but when I couldn't organize an actual scientist at short notice I went on the background telling website and hired an actor to play a scientist now what is your knowledge of science just general knowledge I guess give me an example of a piece of information that you have frogs can leap up to 2.5 meters I think it's so good to know I was kind of hoping for more like science-based knowledge hmm so it's ears on your profile or that you can go Canadian accent as well yeah so come on guys we're gonna go down to the rink to play some pond hockey come on guys let's go to the pond to play some ping pong he's so cheap Canadian accent yeah and soos here you can do a British accent as well yeah give me some of your British accent in place Oh Porter that's really good stuff better this really good stuff sunset pea heart Beach with the help of Adrian we formed one of the least qualified research groups that the world had ever seen I've been studying the flat earth now for about two months and I'm not convinced but everyone told me to do my own research and today I'm doing my own research you're proud of me yes I think so and I'm happy that you've invited me out Roman would you like to elaborate what we're doing yes so basically what are we doing is we're watching the Sun as it goes down and then before I goes down we go and go it is going and in the country room and you can see it Firmin shut the up shut the up okay sorry about this the basic idea of the experiment is that when the Sun goes below the horizon we're going to move to a higher vantage point and when we're out there we should be able to see the Sun again which would - the curvature of the earth or the flatness of the earth well we'll just have to see what happens all we had to do was wait we standing on the precipice of the biggest breakthrough in scientific history Flat Earth expert Adrienne scientific impersonated Roman and year 11 physics not achieved Guy Williams this was the moment the world had been waiting for but moments before sunset everything changed the sun has disappeared behind the clouds that ruins our experiment ever no we would devastate it there was nothing left to say a place we can be sure that the Frog can jump 2.5 meters high if I learned anything about science of my time with Adrian it was that sometimes clouds get in the way were they seeded by NASA to stop us discovering the truth I guess we'll never know Guy Williams New Zealand today ,2
m4kM5zwxThE,"I'm here today to tell you that your
government is keeping you divided. With trust in institutions in its
all-time low and the concept of objective truth 
seemingly harder to agree upon, conspiracy theories are flourishing. The people that are
perpetrating this hoax and the people that really run this world, they're not gonna
let go of all that power easily. No one has an official nomination for a trusted source
of mainstream media. The mother of all conspiracies
is surely the Flat Earth. There is no curvature on this earth,
it cannot be measured. But how do you know
that you live on a globe? Can you prove it? I know I'm not crazy so why should I
be bothered if somebody says I'm crazy? We're not spinning around on the ball. It's not a clear-cut line. Does the horizon stay to your eye level? I can't remember. Or do you simply
trust the evidence you've been shown? Assuming such a lie would be too big. Well, I can see the curve. Yeah, sure you can. Over the past few years, Flat Earth
communities have sprung up online. Not only sharing research supporting their
theories but often incorporating conspiracies that for many are far more
dangerous. From vaccinations to Sandy Hook. But when I visited truth-seeker
Dave Murphy near his home in Sussex, he seemed keen to distance himself from any
formal grouping of globe denials. I'm not part of any movement, I'm just a guy who
knows the earth's flat. Describe for me if you will,
what your beliefs are? I personally believe
that we live on a big disc of water, there's a North Pole in the centre
and all the continents are strung around it. And the edge is what we call Antarctica. Beyond that, who knows what's down there? So this is where anywhere is beyond here, there isn't anywhere …
Does that make sense? If this is a realm over 3D space and time, well there can't be anything
outside it because that implies, you know, 3D space and time. But that only applies here. Right, I wonder if you could describe to me
your circumstances … When you started
to look into this? I've spent the last 15 years
looking for truth. I was at 9/11, you know, I stood there watching it and accepted it for what
I saw. Just like everybody else. It wasn't until about four years later that
I figured out that it can't have happened the way I saw it. I mean I was
having my midlife crisis about that time. Everyone gets to that point in their
life, you know, around about 40 odd that you start wondering, you know, what is
this all for? What am I doing here? Dave took me down to the beach to show
me the most simple Flat Earth experiment. A curvature calculation. Batteries? I took the battery out. There should be just under three feet
of curvature, hiding of the lighthouse. Do you feel like the mainstream
scientific community will concede to …? They can't because it means then almost the
the breakdown of civilisation. If you realise that the Earth's flat
well then hang on, why are we sending things up into space? There is no space,
where's all this money going to? What's the point? The reason behind all
this deception is they've relegated us to a microbe, a speck of dust in an
infinite void with nothing in control. Powerful people who have got more money
than us, can now say, 'you do as we say'. How did your family take the news? My son went off and did his own research, came back and he said,
'yeah, now I agree with you.' And my ex-wife
actually thinks I'm crazy, she thinks I'm mentally ill. It's not craziness, it's
literally what a true scientist should be like. Should be open to everything. Before you became a flat-earther,
did you feel part of society? Now increasingly I've
removed myself from this society because it's a wicked society, it's evil in places. You just have to turn on that
hypno-box, you know, in the corner and every night you see the wickedness coming out of it. Do you ever
have any doubt? I've seen so much now that I can't, I can't see
it any other way. Why am I standing here?
I'm a 50-year-old man, I could easily be sitting at home watching the Formula One or some
other mindless activity. In Hyde Park Speakers' Corner, truth-seekers gather to
spread the word. There are no spinning balls in space. Balls in space come down. Play a game of football,
eventually that ball will come down. There's no ifs and buts. There's one up and there's one down. This is Roxanne Glen,
a relative newcomer to the world of Flat Earth activism. The first time I came here and the first time 
I got heckled by a bunch of trolls, I really had to question what
it was I was doing. I realised, you know, this is actually an argument
to fight that I am having here. Is this my fight? And then I went home, pondered on it and went back to my
mundane job, doing my mundane tasks and realised that no, it is. The more you genuinely
take time looking into it, the more it's like opening up Pandora's box,
it's like, you peel back one lie and then you realise, 'oh they haven't been 
completely honest about that either'. But then why lie? Why do all that? Why not just be honest with us? Is this a growing movement? Yes, yes. I think it is very much so. The public interest in it I think it's definitely
growing as well, especially with the
children, they're not buying into everything that they're shown on TV, like I did when I was that age. What's changed? We didn't have YouTube. Thanks to Trump, they are all walking
around going, 'you are fake news!' If someone like Trump wasn't in
office, I don't think even people would be critically thinking about the media. Roxanne and her friends have been on
tour across the UK for the past seven weeks. You must get some funny looks. Yeah, but good looks as well. There was a lot of people who beeped
and gave us a thumbs up. Really? I was invited to the end of tour party
at a school in west London. Complete with speeches, music
and a glacier mint cake. Despite their vocal distrust of the
media, several people were keen to share their ideas. So pretend there's a dinner
plate stood in the middle so on the outside, you spin it,
if there's something outside you'll zoom off. Right. Stood in the middle, you don't. And then I did the curvature calc
and I realised that the curvature calc said 240ft
should have been missing from a 30ft elevation. And a 123ft from the 1ft observations
and that's what clicked then because that's 49%. I've gone as far back as the Egyptian bible
and the scriptures and I am reading these and to me,
when I'm reading these words, you know, these aren't the words of someone
who's trying to deceive us. These are the words of someone who was trying
to help and guide us. So imagine spinning at 1000 miles/hour, at the edge of a roundabout,
how tight would you have to hold on? I feel like I'm holding on pretty tight now. We've got to the end of this tour now and we've positively started a massive wave
of conversation for people. This is not about Flat Earth
but it's about you. We're trying to all find that feeling, what we're all missing, which is love. So in the name of love,
let's keep telling people that it is flat. Thank you, thank you. Do you think that the Flat Earth provides some
clarity where previously there has been fuzz and mess and complexity? Yeah, I do think it provides a bit of clarity. I am on a journey, I'm also going
through surgery at the moment, on my face, because I got a fracture on my face
that no one knows about. Yeah, I was involved in a horrendous attack, still standing, nearly lost my life though. Went to court, got done for it, been there, done, that was back in 2008. I was knocked out for three weeks by the hospital to repair, in a drug-induced coma. And yeah, I'm still standing. Still fixing myself from that and yeah that's got nothing to do with Flat Earth
but you know … But doesn't it though, I mean do you feel 
that this there's … is there's something in …? Maybe so. It may have changed, kind of your outlook, have changed your willingness
to investigate things. I mean, who knows, right? Maybe so, yeah. I do believe that, I do believe that
sometimes your life experiences mould you into the path you end up going on, or
the pursuit of truth that you're going on … So, yeah, you're probably quite right with that. For Roxanne to still be undergoing surgery for the physical scars of domestic abuse a decade ago, was shocking. To say nothing of the emotional impact of such a breakdown in trust. Singing: We know now, that the Earth's not round That it don't spin round because the truth's been found. Despite the celebratory feel to
the event, this was still a fairly small gathering
of committed activists. For a taste of the Flat Earth on a bigger scale, I flew to Denver, Colorado, to join 800 paying guests at the Flat Earth International Conference, the biggest of its kind to date. The world's going to watch,
they're going to be amazed, they're going to be blown away at not the conspiracy theories,
the conspiracy facts. We're all with the facts. Next to the main auditorium, flat-earthers from all over
were exhibiting their wares. And we leave it alone and it will just be still. How can that hang upside down
anywhere in the world? That's down to gravity though, isn't it? Well, in the imagination. It's opposite, and we're going to be moving
in opposite directions. and that's where you get … We're going to get stuck. The day and night. I mean, how does a lunar eclipse work? That I am not sure about. This is a rocket. What was the idea with this? Basically I just wanted to do a man
a vertical launch. But what's that got to do
with the flat earth? Nothing, nothing. In the conference itself,
a familiar face was drawing the crowds. So what dropity is, it's the tendency
for things to fall when you let go of them. You're a bit of a star here, right?
I mean, come on, don't be modest. Lots of people have come up to you. I mean people come up to
me and said they've come all the way from, you know, Sweden and places
like that just to see me. We've got a photographer now. He can't move anywhere, he's the man isn't he? He says the truth. 'He says the truth', there you go,
what do you think of that? I am just doing what I have to do. Dave, I love you. Thanks a lot, bro. You better get back to your adoring fans now. I don't want to sort of take
any of your time … You shut up. Do you want me to slap you? Dave wasn't the only star attraction
on the bill at this Flat Earth Woodstock. Another speaker,
Denver's own Bob Knodel. How is everybody doing? Beside your eardrums are bleeding, I understand. Bob, great to meet you. Nice to meet you too. Unlike many of the people I met at the conference,
whose Flat Earth beliefs stem from a literal interpretation
of the Old Testament, Bob's approach is based on scientific
rationalism. I've always been a little bit different,
I've always seen the world a little bit different. I was put in special schools, they said that you know
I had a genius IQ which, whatever, but I had a hard time relating
to other people and the world in general. I never was able to understand why
the world seems to be so messed up, you know? Why all these wars, why all the
killing, why do they spend so much money on things like this, when they could just
spend that same money and fix the problems? If you were shown conclusive
proof of a globe earth with your own eyes, how would you feel and would
you be able to adjust your viewpoint to match? Honestly, I would be relieved,
I would be because that would mean that this nightmare is over. Is it a nightmare? It is. It is a nightmare because we're going against
the entire belief system of the entire world. I certainly do not want to
be in the position that I'm in, you know, being ridiculed, being fired from jobs … Nobody wants that
and the only reason I do it is because I truly care about the
future of humanity. Bob took me up to the Red Rocks Amphitheatre, on the edge of the Rocky Mountains to cast a view out over the flat horizon. What are your hopes and expectations for
the future of Flat Earth? My hopes are for all this
to go through as seamlessly as possible, without, you know, bloodshed and
without you know too much conflict. But the people that really run this world
are not going to let go of that power easily. In the short term, things are
going get a lot worse before they get better but when things do start getting better, we're going to go into what I would term
a more utopian type of world instead of a dystopian-like world
that we're clearly headed for. Everyone I've spoken to, when you really boil it down, what people want is
the same as what anyone wants, to have some sort of agency to be relevant to
something, to have love, all these things. Yes. Do you feel the Flat Earth
really delivers that in a way that the globe earth never could perhaps? Of course people are going to want to feel like they're part of something
and not so insignificant, you know, that makes perfect sense. So yeah, when you
realise that and you realise that this world is much more special and
you are much more special, then yeah, it makes a huge
psychological impact, absolutely. Some have referred to the Flat Earth as
a post-truth landscape and whilst this may be meant mockingly, it also reveals a very present need
for finding common ground in the face of irreconcilable
differences. If we're to address the broader
polarisation of society, attempting to understand,
empathise and build trust, are surely important tools to use whatever the shape of your world. ",3
VFns39RXPrU,the Joe Rogan experience are you aware at all of the current state of surveillance and what if anything has changed since your revelations yeah I mean the the big thing that's changed since I was uh in in in in 2013 is now its mobile first everything mobile was still a big deal right and the intelligence community was very much grappling to get its hands around it and to deal with it but now people are much less likely to use laptop then use a desktop than then use you know god any kind of wired phone than they are to use a smartphone and both Apple and Android devices unfortunately are not especially good in protecting your privacy I think right now you got a smartphone right you might be listening to this on a train somewhere and in traffic right now or you Joe right now you got a phone somewhere in the room right the phone is turned off or at least the screen is turned off it's sitting there it's powered on and if somebody sends you a message the screen blinks to life how does that happen but how is it that if someone from any corner of the earth dials a number your phone rings and nobody else's rings how is it you can dial anybody else's number and only their phone rings right every smartphone every phone at all is constantly connected to the nearest cellular tower every phone even when the screen is off you think it's doing nothing you can't see it because radio frequency emissions are invisible it's screaming in the air saying Here I am Here I am here is my IMEI I think it's individual manufacturers Equipment Identity and IMEI individual manufacturers subscriber identity I could be wrong on the break out there but the the acronyms are the IMEI and the IMSI and you can search for these things there are two globally unique identifiers that only exist anywhere in the world in one place right this makes your phone different than all my other phones the IMEI is burned into the hand side of your phone no matter what SIM card you changed to it's always gonna be the same and it's always gonna be telling the phone network it's this physical handset the IME SI is in your SIM card right and this is what holds your phone number right it's the basically the key the right to use that phone number and so your phone is sitting there doing nothing you think but it's constantly shouting and saying I'm here who is closest to me that's the cell phone tower and every cell phone tower with its big ears is listening for these little cries for help and going alright I see Joe Rogan's phone and I see Jaime's phone I see all these phones that are here right now and it compares notes with the other network towers and your smart phone compares notes with them to go who do I hear the loudest and who you hear the loudest is a proxy for proximity for closeness distance right they go whoever I hear more loudly than anybody else that's close to me so you're gonna be bound to this cell phone tower and that cell phone tower is gonna make a note a permanent record saying this phone this phone handset with this phone number at this time was connected to me right and based on your phone handset and your phone number they can get your identity right because you pay for this stuff with your credit card and everything like that and even if you don't right it's still active at your house overnight is still active you know on your nightstand when you're sleeping it's still whatever the movements of your phone are the movements of you as a person and those are often quite ly uniquely identifying it goes to your home it goes to your workplace other people don't have it sorry and anyway it's constantly shouting this out and then it compares notes with the other parts of network and when somebody is trying to get to a phone it compares notes of the network compares notes to go where is this phone with this phone number in the world right now and to that cell phone tower that is closest to that phone it sends out a signal saying we have a call for you make your phone's start ringing so your owner can answer it and then it connects it across this whole path but what this means is that whenever you're carrying a phone whenever the phone is turned on there's a record of your presence at that place that is being made and created by companies it does not need to be kept forever and in fact there's no good argument for it to be kept forever but these companies see that is valuable information right this is the whole big data problem that we're running into and all this information that used to be ephemeral right where were you when you were 8 years old you know we're worried where'd you go after you had a bad breakup you know who did you spend the night with who'd you call after all this information used to be ephemeral meaning it disappeared right like like the morning dew it would be gone no one would remember it but now these things are stored now these things are saved it doesn't matter whether you're doing anything wrong it doesn't matter whether you're the most ordinary person on earth because that's how bulk collection which is the government's euphemism for mass surveillance works they simply collected all in advance in hopes that one day it will become useful and that was just talking about how you connected phone network that's not talking about all those apps on your phone that are contacting the network even more frequently right how do you get a text message notification how do you get an email notification how is it the Facebook knows where you're at you know all of these things these analytics they are trying to keep track through location services on your phone through GPS through even just what wireless access points you're connected to because there's a global constantly updated map there's actually many of them of wireless access points in the world because just like we talked about every phone has a unique identifier that's globally unique every wireless access point in the war right UK promote them at home whether it's in your laptop every device that has a radio modem has a globally unique identifier in it and this is standard term you can look it up and these things can be mapped when they're broadcasting in the air because again like your phone says to the cell phone tower I have this identifier the cell phone tower responds and says I have this identifier and anybody who's listening they can write these things down and all those Google Street View cars that go back and forth right they're keeping notes on whose Wi-Fi is active on this block right and then they build an in a giant map so even if you have GPS turned off right as long as you're connected to Wi-Fi those apps can go well I I'm connected to Joe's Wi-Fi but I can also see his neighbor's Wi-Fi here and the other one in this apartment over here and the other one in the apartment here and you should only be able to hear those four globally unique Wi-Fi access points from these points in physical space right the intersection in between the spreads the domes of all those wireless access points it's a proxy for location and it just goes on and on and on we could talk about this for four more hours we don't have that kind of time can I ask you this is there a way to mitigate any of this personally I mean is me shutting your phone off doesn't even work right well so it does in a way it's just no um the thing was shutting your phone off that is a risk is how do you know your phone's actually turned off it used to be when I was in Geneva for example working for the CIA we would all carry like drug dealer phones you know the old smart phones there sorry old dumb phones they're not smart phones and the reason why was just because they had removable battery backs where you could take the battery out right and the one beautiful thing about technology is if there's no electricity in it right if there's there's no go juice available to it if there's no battery connected to it it's not sending anything because you have to get power from somewhere you have to have power in order to do work but now your phones are all sealed right you can't take the batteries out so there are potential ways that you can hack a phone where it appears to be off but it's not actually off it's just pretending to be off whereas in fact it's still listening in and doing all this stuff but for the average person that doesn't apply right and I got to tell you guys they've been chasing me all over the place I don't worry about that stuff right and it's because if they are applying that level of effort to me I don't probably get the same information through other routes I am as careful as I can and I use things like Faraday cages I turn devices off but if they're actually manipulating the way devices display it's just too great a level of effort even for someone like me to keep that up on a constant basis also if they get me I only trust phones so much so there's only so much they can derive from the compromise and this is how operational security works you think about what are the realistic threats that you're facing that you're trying to mitigate and with the mitigation that you're trying to do is what would be the loss what would be the damage done to you if this stuff was exploited much more realistic than worrying about these things that I call voodoo hex right which are like next level stuff and actually just a shout out for those of your readers who are interested in this stuff fun I wrote a paper on this specific problem how do you know when a phone is actually off how do you know when it's actually not spying on you with a brilliant brilliant guy named Andrew bunny Huang he's an MIT PhD and I think electrical engineering called the introspection engine that was published in the Journal of open engineering you can find it online and it'll go as deep down in the weeds I promise you it as you want we take an iPhone 6 this was back when I was fairly new and we modified it so we could actually not trust the device to report its own state but physically monitor its state to see if of spying on you but for average people right this academic that's not your primary threat your primary threats are these bulk collection programs your primary threat is the fact that your phone is constantly squawking to these cell phone towers it's doing all these things because we leave our phones in a state that is constantly on you're constantly connected right airplane mode doesn't even turn off Wi-Fi really anymore it just turns off the cellular modem but the whole idea is we need to identify the problem and the central problem with smart phone use today is you have no idea what the hell it's doing at any given time like the phone has the screen off you don't know what it's connected to you don't know how frequently it's doing it Apple and iOS unfortunately makes it impossible to see what kind of network connections are constantly made on the device and to inter mediate them going I don't want Facebook to be able to talk right now you know I don't want Google to be able to talk right now I just want my secure messenger app to be able to talk I just want my weather app to be able to talk but I just checked my weather and now I'm done with it so I don't want that to be able to talk anymore and we need to be able to make these intelligent decisions on not just an app by app basis but a connection by connection basis right you want let's say you use Facebook because you know for whatever judgment we have a lot of people might do it you want it to be able to connect to Facebook's content servers you want to be able to message a friend you want to be able to download a photograph or whatever but you don't want it to be able to talk to an ad server you don't want it to talk to an analytic server that that's monitoring your behavior right you don't want to talk to all these third-party things because Facebook crams they're garbage and almost every app that you download and you don't even know what's happening because you can't see it right and this is the problem with the data collection used today is there is an industry that is built on keeping this invisible and what we need to do is we need to make the activities of our devices whether it's a phone whether it's computer or whatever more visible and understandable to the average person and then give them control over it so like if you could see your phone right now and at the very center of his green icon that's your you know handset or it's a picture your face whatever and then you see all these little spokes coming off of it that's every app that your phone is talking to right now or every app that is active on your phone right now and all the hosts that it's connecting to and you can see right now what's every three seconds your phone is checking into Facebook and you could just poke that app and then BOOM it's not talking to Facebook anymore Facebook's not allowed Facebook speaking privileges have been revoked right you would do that we would all do that if there was a button on your phone that said do what I want but not spy on me you would press that button right that button is not a does not exist right now and both Google and Apple unfortunately Apple's a lot better at this than Google but neither of them allow that button to exist in fact they actively interfere with it because they say it's a security risk and from a particular perspective they they actually aren't wrong there but it's not enough to go you know we have to lock that capability off from people because we don't trust they would make the right decisions we think it's too complicated for people to do this we think there's too many connections being made well that is actually a confession of the problem right there if you think people can't understand it if you think there are too many communications happening if you think there's too much complexity in there it needs to be simplified just like the president can't control everything like that if you have to be the president of the phone and the phone is as complex as the United States government we have a problem guys this should be a much more simple process it should be obvious and the fact that it's not and the fact that we read story after story year after year saying all your data then breached here this companies spying on you here this companies manipulating your purchases or your search results or they're hiding these things from your timeline or they're influencing your you are manipulating it in all of these different ways that happens as a result of a single problem and that problem is in any quality of available information they can see everything about you can see everything about what your device is doing and they can do whatever they want with your device you on the other hand owns the device well rather you paid for the device but increasingly these corporations on it increasingly these governments own it and increasingly we are living in a world where we do all the work right we pay all the taxes we pay all the costs but we own less and less and nobody understands this better than the youngest generation well it seems like our data became a commodity before we understood what it was it became this thing that's insanely valuable to Google and Facebook and all these social media platforms before we understood what we were giving up they were making billions of dollars and then once that money is being earned and once everyone's accustomed to this situation it's very difficult to pull the reins back it's very difficult to turn that horse around precisely because the money then becomes pot right right the information that becomes influence that also seems to be the same sort of situation that would happen with these mass surveillance states once they have the access it's going to be incredibly difficult for them to relinquish that right yeah no you're you're exactly correct and this is the the subject of the book I mean this is this is the permanent record and this is where it came from this is how it came to exist the story of our lifetimes is how intentionally by design a number of institutions both governmental and corporate realized it was in their mutual interest to conceal their data collection activities to increase the breadth and depth of their sensor networks that were sort of spread out for society remember back in the day intelligence collection in the United States even at Sigyn used to me sending an FBI agent right to put alligator clips on an embassy building or sending in somebody disguised as a workman and they put a bug in a building or they built a satellite listening site right we called these foreign set or foreign satellite collection we're out in the desert somewhere they built a big parabolic collector and it's just listening to satellite emissions right but these satellite emissions these satellite links were owned by militaries they were exclusive to governments right it wasn't affecting everybody broadly all surveillance was targeted because it had to be what changed with technology is that surveillance could now become indiscriminate it could become dragnet it could become bulk collection which should become one of the dirtiest phrases in the language if we have any kind of decency but we were intentionally this was intentionally concealed from us right the government did it they used classification companies did it they intentionally didn't talk about it they denied these things were going they they said you agreed to this and you did agree to nothing like this I'm sorry right they go we put that Terms of Service page up and you click that you clicked a button that said I agree because you were trying to open an account so you could talk to your friends you were trying to get driving directions you were trying to get an email account you weren't trying to agree to some 600 page legal form that even if you read you wouldn't understand and it doesn't matter even if you did understand because one of the very first paragraphs and I said this agreement can be changed at any time unilaterally without your consent by the company right they have built a legal paradigm that presumes records collected about us do not belong to us this is sort of one of the core principles on which mass surveillance from the government's perspective in the United States is legal and you have to understand that all this stuff we talked about today government says everything they do is legal right and they go so it's fine our perspectives the public should be well that's actually the problem because this isn't okay the scandal isn't how they're breaking the law the scandals that they don't have to break the law and the way they say they're not breaking the law is something called the third party doctrine a third party doctrine is a legal principle and derived from a case and I believe the 1970s called Smith versus Maryland and Smith was this knucklehead who was harassing this lady making phone calls to her house and when she would pick up he just I don't know is that their heavy breathing would ever like a classic creeper and you know it was terrifying this poor lady so she calls the cops and says one day I got one of these phone calls and I see this car creeping past my house on the street and she got a license-plate number so she goes to the cops and she goes is this the guy had the cops again they're trying to do a good thing here they look up his license-plate number and they find out where this guy is and then they go what phone numbers registered to that house and they go to the phone company and they say can you give us this record the phone company says yeah sure and it's the guy the cops got their man right so they go arrest this guy and then in court his lawyer brings all this stuff up and they go you did this without a warrant that was sorry that was that was the the problem was they went to the phone company they got the records without a warrant they just asked for it or they subpoenaed it right some lower standard of legal review and the company gave it to him and got the guy they marched more in jail and they could have gotten a warrant right but it was just expedience they just didn't want to take the time with small-town cops you can understand how it happens they know the guy's a creeper they just want to get him off to jail and so they made him I said but the government doesn't want to let go they fight on this and they go it wasn't actually they weren't his records and so because they didn't belong to him he didn't have a Fourth Amendment right to demand a warrant be issued for them they were the company's records and the company provided them voluntarily and hence Warren was required because you can give whatever you want without a warrant as long as it's yours now here's the problem the government extrapolated a principle in a single case of a single known suspected criminal who had they had real good reasons suspect suspect was their guy and used that to go to a company and get records from them and establish a precedent these records don't belong to the guy they belong to the company and then they said well if one person doesn't have a Fourth Amendment interest in records held by a company no one does and so the company then has absolute proprietary ownership of all of these records about all of our lives and we're going to this is back in the 1970s you know the internet hardly exists in these kind of contexts smart phones you know don't exist modern society modern communications don't exist this is the very beginning of the technological era and flash-forward now 40 years and they are still relying on this precedent about this one you know pervy creeper to go nobody has a privacy right for anything that's held by a company and so long as they do that companies are going to be extraordinarily powerful and they're going to be extraordinary abusive and this is something that people don't get they go oh well it's data collection right they're exploiting data huh this is data about human lives mistake about people these records are about you it's not data that's being exploited it's people that are being exploited it's not data that's being manipulated it's you that's being a manipulated and this this is this is something that I think a lot of people are beginning to understand the problem is the companies and the government's are still pretending they don't understand or Oh disagreeing with this and this is my my ends me of something that one of my old friends John Perry Barlow who served with me at the freedom of the press foundation I'm the president of the board used to say to me which is you can't awaken someone who's pretending to be asleep [Applause] ,2
LiGNRj-SX3Y,from I see my baby seat and it's family we all wanted Ally all her life the mystery of her father's murder has loomed over killest Forsyth in 1993 bulik Forsyth was a manager in the housing department of London's Lambeth Council three months before she was born he was bludgeoned to death and his flat set on fire now Sky News has seen evidence that he could have been about to expose an alleged pedophile ring operating within council premises there are some faxes that points to him knowing something that was going on at work and he was getting ready to play the whistle at the time this crime watch reconstruction appealed for information now this murder is one of the events Metropolitan Police officers looking into Westminster linked abuse are reinvestigating this internal council report obtained by Sky News could be key in details allegations of violent rapes conducted on council premises and the sexual abuse of children it's here what is still the headquarters for Lambos housing department that appeared full ring operating within the council but alleged to have carried out sexual assaults they used the basement the report says where they could rape victims without fear of being interrupted and the report cites new witness evidence suggesting boutique Forsythe may indeed have been killed as part of a cover-up he tried to get away from the housing department telling colleagues he had information which put him at risk our investigation has unearthed some extraordinary allegations but a senior detective told me they've always been taken seriously by the police but this is their first chance at being properly investigated that's something the family bulik Forsyth told me they welcomed honestly it's worse I can't believe some of the stuff that's in here I can't believe actually happened and has just gone under the radar then and hasn't been investigated and looked into like I was very shocked to read this this is the first time killest have seen written in black and white what she's always suspected says there that he was willing to spill the beans and he was scared that if he moved to another department that people in power could still get to him so it seems that he was very fearful about something going on at work the significance of events that took place in Lambeth two decades ago are only now becoming clear in a statement the council said it was working closely with the police and is determined to do all it can to ensure perpetrators of abuse are brought to justice Member of Parliament John Mann is a former Lambeth councillor there's been a huge cover-up there are many victims that are deaths and murders it's about time the truth came out in terms of child abuse in Lambeth the police have issued a new plea for victims to come forward and for the first time bulik full size family know more about the abuse he died before he could expose but they will not give up until they know the truth because not only do I want justice but all the people that have spoken in here deserve justice - and it's horrible to think that they've had to experience some of the things that they have have washed Sky News ,2
xF_VYNtDgN8,"listen it's shocking it's written about in the book of Revelation could it ever happen the answer is unfortunately yes total population control bill Benny says that's what the National Security Agency wants he should know he was technical director of that agency and worked there for more than 30 years he became one of their top analysts perhaps the best code breaker in America before he resigns because of their domestic spying programs he's with us now from Washington bill thank you so much for being with us we're glad to see you well thanks for having me Pat look how big is this apparatus of the NSA we hear about it but you know firsthand well they're I think they're about 40,000 people working at Fort Meade at NSA headquarters close to 40,000 and then they have facilities all around the world plus a number of contractors also associated when probably on the order of a hundred thousand I would think to two hundred thousand that worked for them directly so it's a rather large operation I mean it's it's between ten and fifteen billion dollars a year that they spend on it ever since 9/11 so that's you know quite a quite a bit of money they're investing in it how much data can they acquire is there any limit to it actually it the only limit is in terms of money power availability and space to add to stack equipment to go and collect the data material well they use it well you've said that the ultimate goal is total population control in a democracy that is really scary business it's actually a totalitarian process that's been used down through history I mean that's what totalitarian dictators States they that's what they want to do they want to know everything about the population so they can control it that was the idea between behind the Soviet Union the East German Stasi that was their idea and the Gestapo and the SS and down through history many others is our stuff more powerful than those agencies you mentioned yeah unfortunately it is that's that's the real the real problem I see is that it's the capacity is when you're looking at electronic activity of individuals like when you use a credit card and when you when you make a phone call or email anybody on the on the internet or or do chatter on the internet that can be monitored in near real-time if that if they're necessary otherwise they can capture it collect it store it and then Brett to actively analyze it so it's something that it provides the opportunity to monitor everybody in the country in fact most everybody in the world in near real-time throughout the day and that's that's really a 1984 on steroids really all right now let's take mrs. Joe average living in Topeka Kansas and she goes to the store and buy something with a credit card NSA's got that right then they they have electronic data they'll collect Financial Act transactions sure she calls her friend Myrtle down the street that phone is monitored that call not all of them but a good many of them are recorded certainly all of the fact that they she made that call is is recorded and stored and and what we call graphed that is building relationships that's one of the real problems here it this is a violation of your First Amendment rights under the Constitution you have the right to assemble free free free assembly which means that it doesn't say you have the right to free assembly as long as the government knows about it which is what's happening when the telecommunications companies turn over all their records of phone calls to and from with duration that tells them everybody you're contacting your whole social network on the phone because it's a simple matter of doing a reverse lookup to see who that is that you're calling oh you quit the agency oh she said what they were doing is unconstitutional could you that is clearly unconstitutional but why does the government on doing it that's the reason I been able to at least from what I can see in public in the public domain is they're doing it for law enforcement worldwide and actually the main users of this data are in fact FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration and other law enforcement agencies in the in the country and they they use this data to find criminal activity and then they go arrest people based on this information and then they have to do a parallel construction which means they use normal policing techniques that they would be expected to use to find evidence that would justify and show probable cause for an arrest then they substitute that for the NSA data in the in the courts in fact that's one of the one of the one of the things that happened in challenging that process was one of the lawsuits was Amnesty International vs. clapper and that made it to the Supreme Court and the only way they got rid of that was to basically lie to the Supreme Court and say that well if anybody had any of this data used against them in the court of law or anything that the defendant they defendants would be told and that was simply a lie nobody has been told to date all right when I when I think of this it's just horrible what do they give this information to the IRS that's the other problem the Drug Enforcement Administration has a special unit the Special Operations Division the sod and that's the that division is supposed to its primary purpose is to look into the NSA data to find criminality and criminal activity the members of that are the CIA the NSA the FBI course DEA DHS and the IRS now that means that the IRS as active action actually has actually Act access to all the data of the social networks of everybody in the country because NSA builds those in the databases that they have from the billing data or they or the contact data that's provided by the telecommunications companies so this in effect allows them if they're they're interested in stopping anybody getting a 501 C 3 application in for tax-exempt status for for say someone in the Tea Party or the Act Occupy group or any religious group attempting to get 501 C 3 or tax-exempt status they would look could look into that mapped graphed relationships and see if you're a part of any organization that they perhaps when a stone wall or slow roll and prevent from becoming politically active and that's what's been going on they've had access to this data and one person was testifying in the the House and Judiciary Committee I believe it was about some of the questions they were being asked by the IRS and one of the questions that was asked that gave me the idea that they were using this information was this one person was asked what what is their relationship with another person there was a specific name well the question I had was not what was their relationship but how did the IRS know about that relationship the only way I could think of that they would know was B through this access to the data at NSA which is where all that information is mapped out so what you're saying is the NSA slips this stuff to them they read it and get a clue getting it and then they go through their normal procedures and act like it they didn't get the information but he got it from another source so they they pull the wool over Congress do you know the congressman yes go ahead and they also use that in court which means in my in my sense that that that means their perjuring themselves in court so I call that a planned program perjury policy run by the Department of Justice of the United States you know I'm horrified in all this and I'm sure the average of America you know most of the congressmen are they come out of neighborhoods and they're elected by the people do you think Congress has even a clue as to what you're talking about probably not not a complete clue but I think that that's part of the reason that representatives a marsh and Conyers got a coalition of members of the house to try to unfund NSA's activity last year they almost made it by about 12 votes they lost 12 by 12 votes but they came pretty close for a first try so there is a move in Congress to to limit and stop this and it really is all of this activities it's unconstitutional into the first Fourth and Fifth Amendment's the first because they're giving you or your associations and everything the government is collecting that data the fourth because they're looking at the content it's not just metadata that they're collecting its content also and and and the fifth because they're using data that you knew that content of data that you pass between your friends and neighbors and and use that against you in a court of law that's a violation of the fifth amendment that is to have you're not you are claim you can claim the Fifth Amendment not to testify against yourself well that's a violation of that too how come some little guy didn't come after you in the middle of the night or have they they have actually they sent the FBI at me in 2007 and tried to intimidate me to stay quiet what about Snowden is he a traitor or hero I looked at him as a as doing a absolute public service not just to the people of this country but to the world because he produced evidence that's irrefutable by our government that's the crimes against the Constitution and the laws that we had over time anyway so that was irrefutable evidence of what they were doing and so they cannot deny it now what kind of megalomaniac would want to do something like this is monstrous and these guys I mean where does the mindset come from that divides us all this stuff well that's what I objected to and why I left NSA early on back in 2001 because I saw this coming I mean I had worked the Soviet Union problem for almost 30 years and and it was very clear to me that in October of 2001 the NSA and government the US government started adopting the procedures and techniques and processes that the Soviet Union and the Stasi and all of the countries behind the Iron Curtain were using so we were we were actually adopting their procedures it was very clear to me that that was what was going on all right last question the average person doesn't have a vestige of knowledge of what you're talking about they just trust their government what are we going to do as citizens well you see let me let me say something about that first that's that's really the problem here in this country you see from my where I see what I see is we have not had a dictator in this country for almost since George the third for almost two hundred and forty years so we've been very comfortable over those two hundred forty years at least kind of depending on our government to do the right thing and that's what we've all been accustomed to them doing that is we trust them and have trusted them for a long time and so we don't have that knowledge of what dictators and dictatorial processes are but if you look at it the Germans today are the ones who are really upset about this and the reason they're upset is because they've got living memory of the Stasi and living memory of the SS and Gestapo so they're very familiar with these techniques and procedures and that's why they're very upset to me I think the only way we can get out of this is to fire everybody in DC that's the only way to do it you have to go out and vote you have to get active you can't stay quiet and let this happen you have to stand up and oppose it Bill Bailey thank you so much you're great to Patriot and keep speaking out and oh well as prayers for your protection because I can't imagine think unless you keep on talking but maybe they don't man well folks if you want to learn more about Bill Binney and the NSA you can go to our website there's more detail about it and you know something is he was talking the Bible makes a statement in the book of Revelation that people could not buy or sell without the mark of the beast and you said okay there is no way that there's any governmental agency that could enforce something like that and what this man who is the technical director the NSA former technical director is saying is that the government now has the technique to do this worldwide you know Google has maps of every if you have a little shack up in the hills someplace Google's got a map of how to get there and that's a private agency and you know your credit cards your telephone calls but the thing is what he's saying is that you pick up the phone and call your girlfriend and that's monitored and that's recorded and it's it's frightening you don't have to be saying you know I'm wondering a lot against the government but it just it's a normal conversation and they call it metadata and all that stuff and we don't understand it enough so we say well oh yeah well we don't have terrorists we don't have blowing up our airplanes well of course we don't but is it the price of safety for a few passengers on an occasional airplane is that worth taking away the liberties of all the people and the answer is no but this is Big Brother it is what is written in the book of Revelation and it finally can happen in our lifetime this is scary stuff shocking really shocking I remember reading 1984 and books like the late great planet Earth and thinking that could never happen in our country people would never buy into that and here we sit well it's like the old business of the Frog and the water you can heat it up slowly and we're more and more accustomed to it and every time it comes out and they say oh it's okay it's the USA PATRIOT Act it was put in by George Bush these are good guys and this is you got a nice general up there three-star general he's got a benign looking face and you figure he's not gonna hurt you and so he's in charge and then somebody else well we also grew up being taught and believing that the check and balance system in our government was going to take care of all this this is huge the the gathering is in the billions and billions and billions of bits and it is we finally have the capacity to control every human being on the face of the earth clean him up that's what he said throw the bums out let's start afresh ",2
Rt4a9ie5MGk,my name is Richard Kerr and I'm 53 and I believe my first time being trafficked to England was on February of 1977 Richard Carr has suffered for over 30 years in silence blocking out the horrors of his past at the hands of what he describes it's very powerful people as a teenager he was introduced to the world of Westminster he says he was trafficked from Northern Ireland and that this picture was taken by one of his abusers I was used as a boy toy I was an object a sexual object rumors of an alleged pedophile ring in the top echelon of society have been circulating for years but for the first time Richards account of what happened to him as a boy links three locations Dolphin Square a luxury complex popular with MPs and civil servants kink or a boys home in Belfast where boys were systematically abused and elm guest house a former gay brothel where young children are also said to have been molested we brought Richard back to England from America along with his counselor to revisit his past his memories were vivid and distressing the pro a cottage industry of conspiracy theories has built up around this story but Richard insists a VIP pedophile ring did exist and it's time for the truth to be told they were man who had control and power over others they were politicians he believed some some I do his story starts in Belfast in the 1970s at the now notorious kink or a boy's home he was placed in care from the age of five and sent to King Cora at 14 where he was abused there he claims he and two other boys were hand picked to be trafficked to London and sexually abused by further men both of them he says have since taken their own lives we were for always that's how I felt I felt after all away I was exploited Richard says in 1977 when he was 15 he was put on a ferry to Liverpool abused by a man there then escorted to Manchester and later sent to London claims he was picked up in a car at Kings Cross station taken to a hotel close by and forced to have sex with multiple men I had no way to get to England I had no money you know I was under the state Kerr they were responsible for me I had no one else to turn to this is the place that I remember very well and the memories that I tried to block many many years ago how do you feel about that boy you remember here very emotional very painful sorry it scared he says he's faced years of intimidation and is still being warned not to talk by people he believes are connected to the alleged pedophile ring some of his sharpest memories are of the fear he felt and he says he was visited by detectives on two separate occasions and told to keep quiet they told me to stop stop talking about Kim Cora and that same day they intimidated me here there is another place where they they in in Preston Lancashire they told me they could put me away myself he claims he was trafficked across the UK including two Rochdale Lancaster Manchester and Wolverhampton but it's here at Elm guesthouse in South London that he says he faced his most violent experience it was raided by police in 1982 newspapers at the time said that at least three MPs were questioned it's claimed the late Sir Cyril Smith was a visitor it was being used as a gay brothel and it was alleged children as young as 10 were abused it's the first time Richards being back and the flashbacks come fast I was tied up here I do I do remember that I don't know why I was tied up but I was tied up with with with my hands behind my back I do remember that Lane died and he took photographs they took foot other men were here other man came into the room it just wasn't this one man you're up there of the other man here in the 80s it was reported officers found whips chains and ropes I don't mean to be this way it happened you know I I just don't mean to be it's just holding on all this sometimes that I can't believe this happened in the 1970s in Piccadilly Circus Richard said he was picked out from a group of boys sitting upstairs inside the wimpy fast-food restaurant would you describe the activity round here as a pedophile ring oh you've no yeah there's no question about that oh yes definitely why they had convinced of that because of the people I was involved with uh and the boys were in groups even though we were spread across the tables and the way they set it up the clients and locations one of the locations he claims he was taken to in a taxi was an apartment complex in the heart of Westminster known as Dolphin square it is now at the Nexus of the Met police's operation Midland which is also looking into alleged murders I could have been 16 15 17 I remember going in with this guy man he told me to sit down relax and explain about his glasses and he said he had liked Waterford crystal and he wanted me to have a brandy and we had more brandy and then we had sexual encounter in here did you ever meet any of the men that have been named to have had alleged contact with young boys uh I just don't want to get into that right now I really don't I'm talking to my attorneys legal and why is that why don't you want to talk about it yeah I'm still concerned there are some people still arrive and I'm concerned most of these people were very well-off but most of them had decisions of par that had influence over others why don't you feel yet after all these years that you can name your abusers who were in power I'm still in some fear even though I'm willing to take the courage I need to know that I could have faith in our government and central to achieving that trust he says is getting the government to acknowledge what he calls the untold story of King Cora boy's home that he claims goes way beyond Northern Ireland in 1981 three senior staff at King Cora were convicted of abusing eleven boys there's been two judge led inquiries but allegations of a high-level cover-up continue despite claims that abuse in King Cora was connected to England the Home Secretary Theresa May has so far ruled out including it in the official child abuse inquiry Rhine I when they're not willing to bring King Cora into Westminster that just tells it that the message that sends to me is that just there's some kind of cover-up and her husband it's claimed British security services knew about the crimes in Belfast but did nothing to stop them using the knowledge to blackmail and extract intelligence from influential men in 1975 as the troubles were taking hold a young army intelligence officer called Brian Gamal was working undercover and tried to blow the whistle we brought Richard to meet him for the first time you must be Richard yeah I'm Brian Richard it's good to meet you come on in let's talk come on in brian says he put in an official report about King Cora to a senior mi5 officer but to his astonishment and claims he was ordered to stop digging and forget about it that's the thing that hits me they have I really pushed the thing through in 7576 you could have been rescued I'm sorry thank you thank you for that uh I'd be in a lot of pain that's suffering and uh I have survival kit guilt yeah yeah yeah and yeah it's uh it's a calling I I believe it's a calling and I'm not here this is a selfish less selfish of myself I'm not here to think of me right yeah I get peace from that yes masculine Jesus name Amen but it's hard to heal without the truth and Brian now believes to establish that King coram must be added to the UK inquiry why do you think it should be I think um two words Richard care I think Richards transporting over to the United Kingdom mainland to be abused rather than just being abused in Northern Ireland speaks volumes it ties the two together here's a Concordat knows what goes on in Dolphin Square do you think there was still efforts to try and cover up I do Richard is open about the fact he went on in his adult life in London to be paid for sex with men it was he says the only life he knew he later emigrated to America would you concede that you became a male prostitute uh I would answer it this way I didn't become they made that's what they made me to be I had no awareness that I would be be that they shaped me grim me and that's what my life was he says he's decided to speak out now for his two friends trafficked with him no longer alive to tell their tales it's not about me it's about the voices that didn't have a voice and I'm just I don't know my spirit is a driving me and he has this message for the Home Secretary Theresa May I want those who's responsible brought to justice yes we can't fail on this we just can't if we do this now if we fail on this we are a lioness to continue that they can get away from this because people have decided to turn the other way the idea those inside the corridors of power were part of a sophisticated uk-wide pedophile ring has been dismissed by some but Richard is adamant there was one and that he is living proof you ,3
Pd5qKvUEXOI,"There's protections for animals in filming. I think there need to be protections legally
put in place to protect people when they're filming, human beings. Jennifer Lawrence hopes legislation will be
enacted in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal. Weinstein's decades long chain of alleged
harassment was a dirty Hollywood secret. As far as we know though, all of Weinstein's
accusers were of legal age when the alleged incidents occurred But there is Hollywood's other dirty secret
that victimizes the most vulnerable: children. And someone who has spoken out about this is
and is painfully aware, is former child star Corey Feldman. You freeze, you're in shock, children aren't supposed
to handle that kind of stuff I can tell you the number one problem in Hollywood
was and is and will always be pedophilia. Nobody talks about pedophilia. It's the big secret. And it's widespread? Oh yeah. I was surrounded by them. For years now, as evidenced on Nightline in
2011, Corey Feldman has been claiming that he and his good friend, the late Corey Haim,
were victims of molestation when they were young actors. Last year he opened up to Alex Hudgens. Why didn't you come forward then? Kids are scared. You know kids don't think 'oh I'm going to
go-- first of all for me the person that was doing
it to me the most you know- well I mean I could say that the two people that did it
to me were both close friends of mine. Or so I thought. Feldman claims Haim endured more than him. In his book ""Coreyography"" he alleges that
Haim was raped on the set of the 1986 film ""Lucas."" The following year, 1987, their film 'The
Lost Boys' came out. It was when we were both on the set of ""The
Lost Boys"" that things were happening to both of us. Not from anyone on set but outside elements How did people not know when these are two
young- or did they know and they just weren't doing anything about it? I know he told a lot of people, that's the
thing that's so upsetting to me. It's not like it's just me that knows this
story. Other people know. A lot of people know. They're still working they're still out there
and they're some of the richest most powerful people in this business. Back in 2013 on 'The View', Feldman was insistent
that perpetrators are still out there, but says he won't name names due to statute of
limitation laws in California. He also has another reason that echoes something
we've heard regarding Harvey Weinstein. From what I've seen every time somebody tries
to bring up a public name and they have a lot of money and power and publicity machine
behind them, the person who does the accusing is the one that ends up looking bad. They would pull away the better looking younger
kids and keep them for their own after party and there would be rules no swimsuits in the
pool. In the wake of the Weinstein scandal, the
producers of ""An Open Secret,"" about teen sex abuse in Hollywood, released the film
for free on Vimeo for nine days. Much of the film focuses on an organized system
within Hollywood for grooming and then abusing children. At the end of the day it's gotta change there
are so many people that have been affected by this. ",2
GoVA0fQKb58,okay so how did you now get into ministry how did I get into ministry I had done many things before I had as I said st. alia had gone back to school and then everything I had gotten into college I had gotten into cleaning toilets cleaning cars what Minister area done a lot of things hoped and so the earrings on the street I had done a lot of things with my life but now something happened when I had already become I had already gotten into marketing now from the marketing field I got into the business and at that time something happened and I decided to get saved it was very difficult for me to get saved because at the same time I had also gotten heavily involved in Satanism what sort of certain Oh deep deep deep deep so now here I mean certain ISM I have gone into the world of witchcraft and I'm hearing I want to give my life to Jesus and those who are mentoring out those days those who we would call our seniors in the world in the in the kingdom of Satan those ones they told me there is nothing salvation here you try to get saved we will kill you but I was determined I need to get said in fact they told me within six days just less one day less than a week you're not going to be in this world now me the mother threatened me the more determined then we did know six days I'll get saved married with a certain ISM how is it something that you've gotten into intentionally or you just found yourself that when I was a very young girl we lived next to the church so when I was a very young girl myself and my sister had gone to a particular church that's why me I say Christianity is not purely religion Christianity is being born again knowing Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior and a sudden God now for me when I was a small girl we had gone to a particular chat a mainstream and we told the vicar we want to get saved he went in the guy just looked at us and said we are too young to understand salvation now at that point what I did not know we were desiring to get saved because in the spiritual realm remember we live in two worlds there is the real world and then there is a spiritual realm in the spiritual realm that never was also pursuing our lives it is later after that a few months after that that my sister really went and did everything wrong that can be done and I went on the other side and did anything that I thought was demonstrating sobbing the devil I literally just even the little religion that was in me going to Sunday school on Sunday removed or removed and now we all wear the full black into him and to cut a long story short when this time around I desire to get born again as an adult I was determined but now I was wondering where do I go my memory tells me one day I went to a church and nobody wanted to listen to me so now where do I go and I started praying the rear opreis I could pray I said god I want to get saved but I don't know how to get to you I don't know how people get born again so what do I do if the Lord would have it somebody brought me a pamphlet there was a crusade somewhere and I went to this crusade and the preacher had happened to be in Satanism and got born again so I listened to his testimony and it was so similar to mine I thought he knows everything I do and as the Lord would have it the guy had a word of knowledge but that day you know I didn't know anything about the gifts of the Holy Spirit so that day he calls me out with the word of knowledge and instead of going towards him I ran away I usually just took off but God was merciful so I continued prayed and they are following the event for that crusade listened to the preacher and the same he said there is a lady here who God is going to save and God is going to use her Michael so this time he called me out and he said I shall go bring her she is there and you know I was wearing a pink skirt and a light blue blouse and said this is that one with a pink skirt and a light blue blouse and I wanted to go under that so there she has come for me and the preacher just gave me his phone number instead called me so I went I called him and he spoke to me and prayed for me for hours so that was your turning points I never still got saved spoke to me prayed for me for hours and left me to the Lord the following days I'm seated in my office I had a huge business important export I'm double the office transaction business and all of a sudden the presence of the Lord Kim de and I started weeping repented my sins gave my life to Jesus got born again right there in my own on my own and made a deal with God I'm getting saved not only to come to heaven but also to preach the gospel I will serve you that was my turning point now I got saved there then I remember the preacher called him and told him a I got saved he certified now we start from there and that's how I got into a good church got into college now now my life's turned around I even decide that business can wait I want to preach the gospel and I started training and Here I am because my group so many people get saved and don't end up being a bishop or pastor whoever's how did you get to leadership in church leadership in touch started immediately six months after salvation I did a six months training and then after that as we were graduating we were asked if anybody would like to serve the Lord immediately or do you want to wait and that the course was not over so you are still continuing but as we did with the first phase me I decided I want to serve the Lord as I continued and that's how I started serving God I got into church leadership and I loved it and remember when I got saved that me that I made a deal with God I want to be a preacher I want to preach the gospel within six months of salvation I had hit the streets preaching the gospel all over and God has been gracious a country great God has done me good ,2
-HvknfiPO98,"[Music] [Music] hello I'm Donna Clayton and welcome to a very special edition of faith with flavor it's that time of year again where we see children and adults dress up in costumes to celebrate Halloween no matter how you feel about Halloween the truth of the matter is that spiritual darkness is real the Bible says that we don't wrestle against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers of darkness it's important that we stay informed to help those around us make wise decisions so get ready because today we're going to meet a man who came out of the occult and we're going to find out about the dangers he faced I'm talking about evangelist John Ramirez who now preaches the Word of God and helps people become set free from the powers of darkness we're also going to discuss the power of our words thank you so much for tuning in to faithful flavor I am so honored to introduce to you the man of the hour none other than evangelist John Ramirez evangelist thank you so much amazing to be on your show I only got a man told me some stuff before the camera started rolling so I know this is divine it is divine and more than that you have such a powerful testimony which is my heart for faithful flavor is to showcase those testimonies there is power in your words you know we overcome by the blood of the Lamb like the Word of God says and you are a perfect living testimony of that so let's get right into it let's talk about your upbringing what was it like growing up in your home I think growing up in my home because it was so demonic some people grew up in home that a dysfunction I grew up demonic the function of home my father so everything my house was silent pain you know you had to pretend you're happy you had to pretend that things are good and my home was run by demons and witches and warlocks my father was a demonic warlock they were run by demonic spirits I was she spirits in my house as I would see you in person I mean roam around the house you feel that the devil's presence in the house he was growing up and then go on a witchcraft Church at the age of 8 all the way to the 8th from 80 years I was one of Warcraft church right and this is the the demand the crazy thing about it from 7:00 in the evening to 5:00 in the morning the monitor I was a being wrong and I was being prepared and I was being and putting in a place that the devil wanted to use me for his kingdom now growing up in a home like that I mean I would think that you would be afraid and that you would you know not want to indulge in that but you know there was a point where you ended up you know worshiping Satan how did you get to that place you know you wanted one of the trickiest one of the most delusional tricks that the devil has for time he knows one thing how to penetrate the camp of anomie human being who makes everything go so so so so in my world something going on one of these places you know it was a culture thing because you know about Hispanic people they wanted to worship Saints or Hispanic people it's a lot of candles you know all this man people wanted some good luck and they wanted good luck they wanted to be blessed you know so this is the way we should do it but that was a trap of the devil because 25 years I didn't mean to die living demonic demonic the highest level of witchcraft demonic entity name a doctor even to the point I was sick we're sitting like I said with you to get my mortis I'm marching orders they changed the church to change the people and we're doing people to the dark sides and their own reads across them Jesus Christ did you know that you were being deceived in oh yeah yeah I mean I I know it was like we really justify my situation in everything was a justification I'm just at the time we would justify my situation at time he wasn't even being deceived there's a point I like the power I like to respect because I came from a powers of thought I came from a place of fragmenting yes I was I came from a plane so now I got respect I had witchcraft family I have loyalty I have the devil can't love you you made an image you got so I have all that going for 25 years but in the end Jesus showed up you know I was listening to an interview that you did with CBN and I was so amazed out the part where you said they used to go to different regions tell us about what you would do when you would go to those different regions my assignment was my assignment was available I would I would I would I will witchcraft on in their own people I'll try to hit you from all four sizes so you had no way to brief so so every night our after project and go to neighborhood because you see I know if I can crush the neighbor if I can put different demons in that neighborhood I can paralyze the neighborhood for moving forward in spirit because whatever you paralyze it is parent and controlling this fear around you happens in the natural but there were some neighborhoods there were so neighborhood that these uh you know I used to call them hallelujah people you know you're a nuisance at the time okay but there has something say that again say that again for our audience watching right now it has something the power prayer so I should project I will come out of my body end up in their neighborhoods and yeah now when I get to the neighborhood I was always being a New York City if you've ever been to New York they got these light poles or whatever I don't have them here and I would be a highs delightful Astra projecting and then I was I was trying to come down to the neighborhood to saturate the the region with demonic powers there will come out around the corner they'll be holding hands holding hands call unity in the spirit and they will pray man then would chase me out the neighbor to that prayer the power pure hallelujah how to take off and find some weak neighborhood to mess with the power of all prayers fresh you know you know what's amazing my sister then I can I can bear witness to the power prayer from the dark side and I can bear witness from the fire pray now that I'm in Jesus amen I've seen it from both sides and you know another thing that that makes me realize is that there's power in our words because you when you were going and you were transmitting yourself into those places you were speaking words over them right yeah I mean I will curse them I will try to curse them but you see promise 18:21 says the power of life and death lays in your tongue I will curse but you can't curse what God has blessed so then would turn right now pray back and there was a boy my boy my curse see my assignment and I will come back into my body and I was here at 3:00 in the morning four more hours he that's it how do you people day together my way man I can't believe it I didn't get what I wanted to get done and now let's talk about God bringing me full circle because now you speak words of life man how do you do that

0y4F3UmApDA,[Music] one of the reasons that i wanted to make this film was that i personally related a lot to the satanist and their mission not because i'm a satanist or because i'm particularly engaged in like a church day battle of my own more that i feel a kinship with people who choose to do the difficult work of being heretics you know society needs skeptics and it needs outsiders to stand up for themselves and to like fight against the dominant ideas we need that that's really healthy to have that and so i really appreciated the the role that they were taking on in this particular cultural context and i related to it personally because i feel a kinship to the kind of person who kind of doesn't mind if their point of view upsets you like it's like not a problem for me if my point of view upsets somebody in it but it is a difficult thing to do it does generate a lot of hate uh and animosity how do those themes around satan and satanism resonate right now for me it seems kind of obvious that there's been a complete reversal in the roles of who's ostensibly the good guys and who are the bad guys right now we have evangelical nationalists pushing a theocratic agenda in the united states and making great headway to take away people's reproductive rights endorse corporal punishment in schools uh spread pseudoscience or otherwise reject a scientific point of view in really undermining liberal democracy so at this point there seems to be an impair apparent intuitive grasp of what satan can mean in a heroic context and i think you see that vindicated in the film when you see how quickly we've grown and how how much that kind of iconography has resonated with people they instantly seem to grasp it some people don't of course and and object it out object to it outright but we have seen that you know it speaks to people in ways that we could have never predicted from the start the main challenge in figuring out how to structure the story of the film is simply that the satanic temple is doing so much um you know a lot of their activities that were really important and interesting didn't make it into the film um you know 95 minutes is not that long um especially because we wanted to make sure we covered the beginning like we wanted this to feel like this is the origin story of the satanic temple we wanted to leave it feeling very much like this is not the end of the story so it was difficult to leave a lot of the really amazing work they do out and it was also a little bit difficult to predict what was going to happen i mean there was just a lot of activity and we were chasing you know different chapters around the country doing really exciting things in their local communities and you know national campaigns and there's just a lot uh to sort of navigate but you know we just tried to keep true to like what would be what would be like the best starting point for an average audience member and then with that in mind how can we make sure we're not doing a disservice to the more informed satanist who watches the film and i don't want them to feel like their intelligence is being insulted so finding the balance you know with the uninitiated and then also wanting to be sure that satanist would like it too was i think pretty hard i think we did a good job but it was difficult since the start of the trump administration there's been even more pushback against what you do yeah but there's been also that kind of concurrent uh understanding of a need for the kind of activities that the satanic temple are doing within hours of trump being declared president our membership numbers really spiked and if we looked at the metrics for our website and other kind of web activity it was like a straight line upward on uh on election night because people realized that this was you know if they viewed it as a joke before it wasn't a joke anymore and that the the the uh rise of theocracy was was very real a lot of people don't understand like just how big of a part the evangelical rights vote played in the election of donald trump and we leave this out of the film because frankly we didn't want to look at his face um but you know it's sort of in the world around us right like is as much as like donald trump himself is like certainly not a believer in anything you know the evangelical right really did a lot of work to elect him and so and he's repaid them in various ways and so i feel like the work the satanic temple is doing is particularly resonant now i also think that we're in such dark political times that people who maybe typically wouldn't uh care what the satanists have to say uh might be a little more open-minded in their desperation for answers but the theocratic right has been emboldened by the election of donald trump and as soon as he was elected you could see these kinds of bills against abortion being pushed to be passed in states like texas and ohio against you know fetal heartbeat bans as soon as the fetus starts a heartbeat they were saying that's about six weeks sometimes women don't even know they're pregnant at that point trying to ban abortions trying to ban abortions outright and pushing other kind of theocratic agendas nationwide and there's a very centralized well-organized well-financed force trying to undermine the the very spirit of the united states constitution and give exclusive privilege to one religious viewpoint and we're really a grassroots movement without any of that financing and without any of that networking yet and we're making great strides just because the law really is on our side at least for now do you see anything satanic about trump no we're not mindless agents of chaos and when you look at trump he is absolutely mindless that that man is is about as stupid as they could possibly get he's not qualified to work a stock boy job at a grocery store he's completely unaware of his failings right so there's there's no no drive for knowledge there and there's no no real appeal to scientific fact upon which he bases his beliefs which is something we strive to do every day and it's not that we're just looking for disorder chaos and to undermine uh western civilization in fact we're trying to really endorse for enlightenment values bringing reason and respect for science into bettering the human condition and that has nothing to do with trump's agenda planning any big you know stunts or sort of like ironic events or anything going forward that you know we may hear about before long well we're actually uh researching now the possibility of opening up a protected reproductive rights clinic uh and we're searching different states in which we could do that and uh we want to move into lobbying and model legislation and openly do that in the name of satanic lobby and i think a lot of people will think up front that there's no way we can make any headway but people thought that when we started doing anything we were doing and i think we're just going to keep pressing forward and not taking into account as we always have not the the way people respond when they hear satanist i mean we're just going to show them who we are by what we do and they can accept it or reject it ,2

spacely's our chosen topic the ninth circle cult [Music] if you haven't heard of the NCC there's a good reason why reptilians space Wizards are actively and aggressively suppressing its gas the Illuminati has an entire division wake up sheeple dedicated to cleaning the internet every few minutes of any information that could lead to the exposure or capture of its high-profile members another reason you may not have heard of this cult is it almost every detail of information included in any quote-unquote reports on this subject are from sources that don't seem to be entirely reputable we're gonna explore them thoroughly so you can see for yourself as we'll see people's fears over the elites of the world brainwashing hunting killing eating [ __ ] the common folks babies feed the majority of the ninth circle cult narrative while the ninth circle cold may be a little hard to believe in there are however many other examples of real incidents of pedophilia that make the existence of the NCC seem way too possible and we're gonna look into many of those incidents say in particular we're gonna take a peek at the many sexual abuse scandals within the Catholic Church and we're also gonna delve into the Jeffrey Epstein case and his pedophile Island before we're looking to have seen Kazik scandals other examples of this pedophilia incident for sure happened let's thoroughly examine the ninth circle cult so you can see where my hesitation over the reality of this cult comes from the main question we want to answer first our European royal and upper ranks of the papacy and God knows who else members of sort of some sort of sick deranged cult a cult who kidnaps sexually abuses hunts naked children children they kill innate children whose body parts are sometimes kept his mounted trophies now initially this sounds completely wackadoodle insane right I mean there's no way this could be real could it well but sadly elements of this tale have already for sure happened in numerous other instances I mean we did learn in the Robert the butcher baker Hansen suck that at least one guy did get away with hunting human beings and he got away with it for years we also know that pedophilia on a massive scale has been covered up time and time again thanks to numerous Catholic Church scandals we know that people have somewhat recently gotten away with eating human children thanks to the Albert Fish suck and we also know things too sucks on serial killers like Jeffrey Dahmer that people have cat human body parts for trophies but did all of this happen more within a secretive European society known as the ninth circle cult is it even a real organization let's dig in information about the ninth circle cult can be found on a variety of shall I say questionable websites like secure dot avaz dot org Catholics are not Christians calm Europe reloaded calm sites that I went on way too many of these they look like the same dude design them someone who stopped learning how to build websites around 2007 and these websites say it's the same information getting passed around in a variety of sites says ninth circle is a group that participates in satanic worship by performing illegal acts towards children including rape torture and murder it is a creation of the Jesuits within the Catholic Church and is membered by some of the most prominent political and financial figures in the world the group was found guilty by the international common law Court of Justice of countless child murders and mass graves in Canada the Netherlands Spain and Belgium among other places the Pope is considered the head of the group and it is ritualistic as as exposed by their doctrine the Magisterial privilege that the newest sitting pope must drink the blood of a newborn child this point has already been irrefutably proven with witnesses and testimony in a court a painful blow to conspiracy deniers irrefutable proven take that conspiracy deniers bold claim to say the least it's been proven in court that the pope drinks the blood of a newborn child could that possibly be true reading that led me to google has the pope drank the blood of a newborn baby I want to find that irrefutable proof maybe a pic maybe a video the Pope wearing like a like I love babies kind of kind of barbecue bib gobbling up some tender baby legs you know like I'm like a Midwestern football fan gobbles up some buffalo wings eaten nose baby like baby link baby legs baby legs unfortunately fortunately nothing even quasi legitimate comes up when I try to find evidence of the Pope drinking baby blood a lot of basement websites do pop up one of the first baseman websites is the gathering spot net same web site designer is the other questionable websites half of these sites I didn't even make it to because I would I would click on them and then they would set off a CodeRed security alert on my web browser I do want to know if the Pope is in fact eating babies I don't want to have my identity stolen what a bunch of spyware it snuck onto my hard drive an article published on April 17 2004 the gathering spot sites someone named Judy Byington in an article titled witnesses testified that Pope Francis raped them while participating in child sacrifice rituals that's a pretty again bold claim you know and he has tied you know to the United circle cult is being basically the leader supposedly Judy originally broke this story in an article in the examiner I click the examiner link they provided it's a dead link a lot of dead links on these sites so then I googled Judy Byington the examiner to see if she's a real person let alone an author more questionable sites follow I click on e survey or ei survey WordPress our ei survey dot wordpress.com there's an article titled UN panel confronts Vatican on child abuse examiner Judy Byington this article dated January 16 2014 goes on to describe an actual sex crime trial against some real priests that did actually take place in Geneva Switzerland speaks of a vatican apology regarding a variety of pedophile cases within the catholic church does not address the pope drinking baby blood which I wouldn't think would come up if that didn't indeed happen that's not a detail you leave out not something you post in an addendum the following week right just ah forgot to mention last week that in addition to apologizing for a variety of Church sex crimes the Pope also apologized for eating a couple preemies he's very sorry about that he was he was quite hungry when it happened and he regrets his decision I mean hindsight as they say is 20/20 so yeah he now for sure understands you should never eat babies even when you know they're delicious because you've eaten so many other babies this article doesn't mention Judy does list her as a source so I do more digging then at long last I find Judy Byington Byington is presented as an expert on Satanists in an article on The Herald extra com slightly less shady looking website very tabloid II Byington is or was a social worker in therapist who was the CEO of Provo family counting Center in Utah former supervisor over Children's Services for Alberta mental health and she wrote a book called 22 phases this is a book about a woman named Jenny Hills experience of growing up within a satanic cult if that happened Judy's book describes secret ceremonies in which malevolent men and women cloaked and hooded robes hiding behind painted faces and chanting demonic incantations while inflicting sadistic wounds on innocent children lying on makeshift altars or tied to inverted cross a so very ninth circle cult kind of uh you know descriptions here and how does Jenny know all of this happened to her good old recovered memories he-hey recovered memories once again if you don't know they hold about as much weight in court testimony as dreams do because they're as reliable as dreams you know they've been proven time and time again to be entirely unreliable numerous people have been sent to prison only to be released years later when their sentences are vacated when people realize that recovered memories are completely manufactured their false memories legitimate therapists no longer used memories recovered through interviews with alternate personalities or hypnosis because these quote-unquote memories have been proven over and over and over again - like they couldn't be more unreliable you know more times than not it's just made-up [ __ ] it's like again like dreams or nightmares or whatever there's been numerous suicides committed by people who thought that they did by saying this for years when in fact that never happened after however these memories we know recovered again a lot of people who went to jail because he's made very dangerous legitimate therapists again do not do this anymore at all I would discuss this more here but we have went into the science of false memory syndrome numerous times before like in the Mandela effect to uh suck let it suffice for me to say here that the mind is very complex it's an interesting muscle with an imagination so powerful it can convince itself that it remembers things happening for sure when those things for sure never happened Judy admits that all the tales of ritualistic satanic abuse were constructed from recovered memories the entire book is based on a debunked psychiatric practice and again Jenny's memories come from multiple personality so if indeed she does have different personalities you know she's suffering from something now usually termed a dissociative identity disorder so now we're getting questionable memory from someone who is severely mentally ill someone who has a hard time processing reality in general so from these highly questionable memories that were corroborated by zero additional evidence Jenny Hill told Judy she was oppressed by a Jewish Nazi who worshiped Satan and was brought to the u.s. from Germany under CIA sponsorship to partner up with more satanic pedophiles hiding in high places in the u.s. uh-huh it sounds totally legit nothing weird about this story at all nothing reeking of the delusions of someone who is severely mentally ill and then sends her experience with Jenny Judy Byington now see Satanic pedophile cults everywhere she looks they're everywhere and she of course fully believes in the existence of the ninth circle cult all of course fits right into her very paranoid worldview Chanel let's circle back to the ninth circle cult description where it states that the Pope for sure drinks baby blood saying this point has already been irrefutably proven with witnesses and testimony in a court where they refer to this court court what Court has this been proven him so I looked into this as well the court referenced in ninth circle lore is called the International common law Court of Justice also known as the International Tribunal of into crimes of church and state so the ICL CJ and the ITC CS well the highly esteemed ITC CES is supposedly based in Brussels but good luck finding it good luck finding it there or anywhere else you can't find an address for this place or any other mention of this place outside of strange little conspiracy riddled corners of the web and why is that well because it's very likely not real this Court does not nor has not ever existed the court was invented in the mind of insane 63 year old Canadian conspiracy theorist Kevin Dee and it a defrocked United Church of Canada minister the International Court everyone refers to when speaking about the ninth circle cult was first showed up on his blog murder by decree dot-com kevin annette little more to learn about him also an enthusiastic supporter of the freeman on the land movement as well as a chemtrail truther who has also said the United Church of Canada is not nearly transphobic enough sounds like a real fun guy to be tracked to the bar with so let's just uh delve into his brain a little bit to show that the guy who came up with most of the ninth circle you know conspiracy law or found out about it if you want to go that way let's just see what other things he believes it this Freeman on the land movement is this ludicrous notion we're so-called free men think they can opt out of being governed seriously they think that what normal people understand to be laws are merely a form of contract that applies only if one consents to it I know I've mentioned this before uh neither time-suck or the secrets like at one point basically they believe that you can say a few super secret legal phrases and then these phrases are then just gonna get better everything you want to pay taxes yeah you can't be arrested every single law enforcement branch of every single government in the world disagree strongly with this belief how the [ __ ] do people believe in [ __ ] that's crazy and just so stupid like how can you have a brain that works well enough to allow you to have a job and get married drive back and forth in between the store and home and you know etcetera but but also think if you just learn some secret you know a lot peanut butter sandwiches type phrases you could just legally do whatever you want because the laws of the world no longer apply to you if that code were to exist in which it for sure does not if it exists and someone will just post it online and then would go viral and then no one had to pay tax has ever again the government would crumble and we were just be living in an anarchist world of continual structure fires and people getting raped in the streets would be pretty sweet though if there was a cheat code for taxes and arrests I mean please catch it right after you kicked your enemies door down and put a few bullets in their heads they're like freeze talk to weapon and then you're like show bees that's how they don't Hollywood and the officer just put their weapons down just god dammit all right all right buddy I don't like it buddy he knows the code phrase he's free to go IRS send you letter you know ask you to go to court to settle a unpaid taxes dispute we're gonna have to pay a thousand thousand dollars go to jail and you just send back a little post-it note just put a post-it note in a envelope showbiz Holly do it in Hollywood just case dismissed I'm Kevin D Annette's the main proponent of the ninth circle cold he believes the [ __ ] that's crazy he also regularly accuses the Vatican the Government of Canada and the United Church of Canada of being far worse than Hillier so he's not he's not history he also claims that he's been officially nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize twice no [ __ ] way that happened Kevin's blog has convicted quote/unquote according to him and no one else two consecutive pokes of genocide and child trafficking he that he's issued international arrest warrants for them that no one has ever served he's also issued a proclamation that's my favorite part he is issued a proclamation dissolving Canada and he's replaced Canada with the Republic of kanata yep Canada's not officially respond to the Kevins claim they're no longer a real nation kevin's seems to be one of the few people who knows a that there was a revolution against the canadian government and that be the revolution no knows about was successful they did overthrow the canadian government and again kevin main guy behind the ninth circle conspiracy it seems as if he came up with this entire thing himself and kevin really does seem to be a crazy pathological liar there's a lot of sites that share his were his work and they all kind of seem to have the same look as if they may have been created by him from lack of a better term they don't look credulous neither does kevin by the way neither does judy Byington i'm not gonna go into detail about why i say that in case i end up describing how one of you meet sachs looks but you know some people just don't look trustworthy judy and kevin have to kind of look where like if they were a cashier to gas station i might not think twice about him in that context i might assume like okay they can i can handle that job but if i was about to get surgery like an important surgery but than my life depended on and then the surgeon showed up looking like one of those [ __ ] so nervous i'm gonna be making my peace with this world cuz i'm gonna think that i'm probably done well it seems like all the ninth circle or does come from kevin a few ninth circle cult believers claim to have gotten their info from an article that was supposedly released in june of 2014 spread widely in 2015 to the present an article possibly written by someone else hard to say since the source cited is the origin of this tale a website called humans free calm no longer exists neither do its archives i'm guessing either powerful people in high places killed this website's you know deleted it from the web or kevin d annette launched the website then cited it in other websites to give his story just a little bit more legitimacy and then eventually got rid of the initial website I did find numerous sources accusing Kevin of doing exactly at numerous sources accusing him of creating fake websites to back up his claims so it does seem like something he would do one of the anti Kevin websites is actually called Kevin must be stopped dot wordpress.com who knows maybe Kevin also runs that web site to make it seem like you know people are out to stop him from spreading the truth but let's look into what this initial kind of cue document source says an article that may have originated on humans free.com says teens were drugged stripped naked raped hunted down in the woods and killed by European Royals according to this week's latest I witness to testify before the international common law court of justice in Brussels not a real court the woman was the fourth eyewitness to give accounts about these human hunting parties of the global elite night circle satanic child sacrifice cult Network a former member of the Netherlands criminal drug syndicate known as octopus testified that victims were obtained for these human hunting parties from juvenile detention centres in Belgium and Holland octopus that's a cool code name for a drug lord I mean if I owed a drug in or some money I'd be scared if all of a sudden he was like brah we don't get stray by Friday octopus can pay you a little visit octopus and you'll [ __ ] around gonna beat so bad you're gonna think he has a tarts hide of us has the same a man that's a guy's name and yes water nerds I dunno the scientists now say that octopuses have six arms and two little octopus leg ease even though they all look the same here's another snippet from his article 2004 I was an involuntary witness to torture rape and murder sessions of drugged children performed for a group of high ranked people of the Netherlands stated a woman I was taken to a hunting party in Belgium close to Brussels where I saw two boys and girls oh and a girl ages 14 to 16 hunted and killed by global elites that she would use that terminology to who says that conversationally who are they killed by global elites the human hunting party was heavily guarded by the Netherlands Royal Guards I was told that King Albert of Belgium was present huh let me get this straight you you were told that King Albert of Belgium was president that's that sounds legit that sounds exactly like how a high-profile secret cult would operate by telling random witnesses who they've inexplicably brought to watch these hunting rates who their members are right when does that ever happen in the world something like listen [ __ ] will [ __ ] kill you if you breathe a word about this to anyone you see that guy right there that's King Albert and he's gonna [ __ ] hunt some kids right now and when he's done I guess you're free to leave but don't tell anybody about this very secretive organization and for some reason let's random people hang out and watch the things they do that's it's beyond nonsense King out for the second by the way King from 93 to 2003 is never been accused of any crimes relating to pedophilia outside of the ninth circle cult that I am aware of if all this doesn't seem you know far-fetched enough for you check out this ninth circle occult description little excerpt about penis trophies eyewitness is confirmed that as children and youths they were forced to attend human hunting parties where they and other children were raped with some killed and deceased boys penises were cut off allegedly there was a Dutch countryside Palace where boys penises were displayed like trophies on a wall some hunting parties were hosted on the grounds of Belgium Queen Beatrix Palace what the [ __ ] was this serving section of someone's trophy room that would be can you imagine walking into a like a royal Country Estate and then you go into a little trophy room and there's like a stag's head on a wall and some African antelope heads you get some some kudu little Springbok American elk bull Rams head stuffed grizzly bear stuffed Bengal tiger and then just back in a little darkened corner just a row of mounted little boy dicks how do you even mount a dick for a trophy display by the way with the balls underneath do diem mounted erect or flaccid half heart shaved her hairy she only mount the biggest dicks seems like a sad floppy little three-inch you know limp-dick these can be a shaker fee look at this topic it's doing to me what this big deal with D trophies why size matter why sloppiness matter or you know think Chikatilo penis worthy of mountain chica tiller limb shame [ __ ] more still impressive than 90% of hard American capitalist greed wean that is showbiz that is for mother [ __ ] other serial killer times of characters Chikatilo firsts no one makes dick joke like Chikatilo [ __ ] Hollywood that is how they do it in Russia alright been a while since Chikatilo shut up show us some force just felt him in his topic I guess adding a little more to ninth circle online lore a guy named Randy shock recently self-published a book called shocks double 14 the ninth circle on May 2nd of this year the ninth circle just one volume a very long list of super credible nonfiction titles knocked out by the by the random Nader he also wrote shocks double nine octopus spider this important work of literature is described as a startling account of corruption hypocrisy at the heart of the Vatican according to Randy himself it's a brilliant piece of investigation Friday love that when somebody's right in their own review is just laid on thick it's it's according to myself my book is a brilliant piece of investigative writing based on four years authoritative research including extensive interviews with those in power none of his books have any citations zero not one not one reference nothing that's no sources at all he also wrote shocks double seven historic Kansas this is a book about ms-13 and other illegal immigrants taking cars and homes and land and businesses from people living in Kansas and if that book is like Randy's ninth circle welcome guests and it's a little you know light on the truth as well and here's my favorite so he gets so many books I mean it's like he pumps out like a book a month at least he's been doing this for years extensive library of work here is Randy's author profile on Amazon where he describes himself and this thing made me cry laughing I know it might just be me it made me laugh harder than anything has made me laugh in a long long time just cuz this again this is his author profile supposed to talk you know speak to your you know author credentials talk about your books talk about you know where you went to school if you did go to school talk about any awards you won talk about what you know list your books have appeared on the genre you're working in your why you're passionate about this type of okay here's races hello this is your author when I write I pray and I ask Jesus to guide me I keep everything very simple and I asked the Lord to guide me with each word I write my prayer is that my books will help people and improve their lives I am so thankful to have the blessing of being a writer as I have written really since the 1970s and I was also taking notes and writing even in the early 1960s from the time I began writing in the third grade I simply loved words there was about 40 commas in that sense when I was a police officer I used the system where the officer speaks into a telephone and the words are recorded in his report I'm gonna pause for every [ __ ] one of these comments cuz it's delicious I did this for about a year on the WPD in Wichita Kansas and I have to say I love doing my police reports I wanna posit here and say that Randy only got to write those reports for about a year because he was let go how many guys seen him I guess he was let go from the PD because he's out of his [ __ ] mind uh here's the rest as Bob gets better I also love doing investigative work and I like all that is involved with the good side of governing and politics and even news broadcasting as my dad was a very good news reporter and investigator who really got me started with him when I was six years old doing all kinds of things a little six-year-old kid should never ever do that was one sentence it was fun my dad was a real character and he knew everyone in country music like what real left her in there why does that do anything and one of his best friends was Paul Harvey I doubt it I doubt that's true and if it was true what the [ __ ] does have to do with your books first oh my god ah this weird rambling stream-of-consciousness pile of word vomit just it just keeps it keep going it keeps getting better I think I met Paul and he shook my hand he told me that I needed to be a writer I have no particular ideology on any side and I do love our 1776 republic in our healthy US Constitution I always pray for our government and our Senate and Congress I think that's kind of in the governmental you need a separate test and I pray for the president also in the government no matter who is in the White House for the dignity of the office I love capital and I love people ah today I was with my neighbors and I love seeing their wedding teeth and I love seeing their wedding certificate from 1992 what does it have to do with anything they are wonderful people his name is James and he is a u.s. Marine and his pretty wife is Suzy my best man Paul called me today and I went to the YMCA this is think I'm not making this up this is his [ __ ] Oscars bio that is about it for now god bless and enjoy your life you are the most important person on earth to the Lord Jesus died for you and he rose from the dead just for you and then he ends with see you later but this is the guy who is written a book about the ninth circle quotes I love he's just I'm right my buyer right now would love to write more but I go to YMCA that waiting it was pretty sweet Tata for now I mean can you imagine if Stephen King wrote like a similar bio like when you have one of his books and you know it's about about the author and just phrase hi happy birthday if today is your birthday if not have a happy day anyway god bless I always liked scary stuff as a kid this morning I had oatmeal for breakfast sometimes when I was younger I used to eat pop-tarts last fall one of my neighbors died and I was pretty sad hey did you know my dad knew John Miller he ran a hardware store downtown and sometimes were a pair of purple shoes I used to think look pretty cool I don't like cats they're probably nice mostly but not for me anyway tennis elbow is real problem for some people sounds fun but I hear it's painful love to write more but my sandwich isn't sitting right in my Tumtum and I need to use the bathroom ASAP see you later so this is the guy this is the guy writing the ninth circle he also has 42 different books you can buy for you good reads all of his titles are digital they're all insane books like the human race was created with dark skin question mark the duped white race question mark this guy just keeps getting better another book is Planet Wicca or dodo visions Ordovician rises up from nowhere question mark a lot of question marks new titles demonic Ouija board spell casting starts again question mark the true Nazi saga of George Herbert Walker Bush almost all of his titles have zero ratings or reviews I haven't see all platforms so what did Randi have to say about the ninth circle cult well let me say after you know read his bio I don't think it'll be shocked to hear that it's it's quite hard to read there's virtually no grammatical structure just stream-of-consciousness borderline gibberish just the rantings of a madman weaving in and out of accounts of real Catholic pedophile cover-ups and then totally unsubstantiated accounts of that fake Court we just talked about trying various leaders and church officials even some celebrities of crimes involving you know doing horrible [ __ ] to kids babies mostly he covers everything we've already covered he does throw in some new details stuff like Pope Ratzinger resigned after his guilty verdict by the ICL CJ Court in 2013 while Catholic Jesuit Superior adolfo pension announced his resignation in May 2014 both still resided under protection at the Vatican even today children and teens were said forced to participate in human sacrifice rights and human hunting parties many organized by an office at the Vatican love that detail I love that somebody thinks that the Vatican has an office and that office is in charge of like setting up you know hunting kid parties little kid hunting rates I just how do you answer the phone at that office hello you've reached the Vatican's office 14 [ __ ] and hunting oh I'm sorry you're looking for how to buy a new rosary yeah yeah let me transfer you praise God then Randy continues victims were evidently secured by a mafia arm called McGregor Quetta they saw the cat nonsense word or octopus and then taken to private estates and properties owned by prominent business and political leaders including European royalty in the US Europe the Netherlands that's [ __ ] that's that's in Europe and Australia hello people do that listen they're everywhere they're in the United States and Europe and the Netherlands that's [ __ ] in Europe they're the children youth were stripped naked raped hunted down and killed in satanic rites that typically involves sex orgies involving children and teens prior to killing babies others throwing everything in this the innocents were reportedly forced to drink urine and blood eat human flesh and watched others murdered some of their close friends and human sacrifice rights was Albert Fish an early member of the ninth serve occult sounds right up his alley oh yeah bring me that hot apple cider peanut butter now bring the cat-o'-nine-tails we'll have a real Syndic of humdinger hello my darlin hello my baby hello da9 so-called showbiz already talks about mass graves as well mass graves are another big part of the ninth circle cult lore there supposedly are a ton of kids buried in a variety of mass graves and these graves have been found but somehow not been mentioned by mainstream news sources pretty weird says since 2008 there have been 34 mass grave sites believed filled with children's bodies found in Ireland Spain and the Anglican United Church of Canada though mainly Catholic native residential schools in Canada the mass graves were believed to hold well over 350,000 800 missing injured indigent children and those of political prisoners who disappeared out of Catholic orphanages schools and hospitals via the present Pope Francis man lot of people all mass graves have been refused excavation by owners of the properties Canada Spain and Ireland governments and the Anglican United Church of Canada and Catholic Church so again you know sounds pretty legit authorities know where the bodies of you know hundreds of thousands of kids are buried but when they come to check on the graves you know some organisation like the United Church of Canada can just be like nah I like that's like that's ever worked hello father we have a warrant to search the property for the bodies of thousands of hunted and murdered children now father please let us in we need to look for those kids right now hmm please let us investigate the murders of thousands of children their parents deserve to know what happened huh now nope hmm right and then there's why these okay all right dang it and then just walk away if anyone listening still thinks Randy is credible at any level check out how he ends his book this is the closing argument of his long book his long ramblings this is the last paragraph okay so far I have 14 wood hay and shock stubble books on the Vatican gee whiz I wonder I love when people say gee whiz gee whiz I wonder how many father Drew has done so far himself I am totally trusting Mary plus I am resting in the holy spirit and I'm depending on Jesus Christ I am writing these books as I write all of my books only to the glory of God and my goal is to reveal the church for what it is it is a mess and it is far worse than that you could just skip them at if you think it's far away then why even mention that not only are there large number of men who are homosexual and pedophile tiny child molesters they are often also killers of little children for the devil it is all this bad okay it's all it is all this bad you guys it is all this bad and that's what the ninth circle called conspiracy is it is gibberish everything I can find online about this cult is perpetuated by the intellectual equivalents of Randy shock and Kevin D Annette it truly seems to be complete nonsense created in the minds of not real bright paranoid conspiracy nuts also seems to be invented by Kevin D Annette and post on his blog and then other possibly mentally ill people like Randy shock me sounds wrong with a guy added to the mythology the similar claims of obvious wackadoodles like judy Byington also woven into the back story to provide further evidence it is the internet whisperings of delusional maniacs I'm gonna go with snopes.com put a big old all caps bold font false rating on the existence of the ninth circle cult the idea though of elite sacrificing eating and/or [ __ ] aired show is nothing new and historically kids have been sacrificed you know so I get where some of the concern come from you know we learned that about that way back in the you know with the Aztec times there's kids being sacrificed that's happened in the history of the world we'll look at some much more credible pedophile cases because it's suck on only the ninth circle cult just isn't quite meaty enough and while I do make fun of this particular cult I do understand the motivation for how people could believe it because we are going to look at examples of real horrible things that have gone on and when you add them all up it's like it just makes something like this seem a little more plausible without some of the cartoonish elements like the robes and stuff and I'm gonna dress that too cuz that just comes up all the time there are all these satanic cults we're gonna get into has that even ever happened before we explore some real pedophiles some of which you know seem to have been part of real pedophile rings let's have a little more fun with the ninth circle cult believers and hop into an atheist of the internet right after a sponsor time-suck is

mm-hmm posted a video titled breaking all caps breaking woman witnesses child sacrifice at Vatican 34 mass graves found Pope and Queen involved and then attack you know there's a lot of ninth circle cult in the description underneath spoiler alerts instead of 30 for mass graves found of children raped and murdered by pedophile cults 0 such mass graves have been found the video has one hundred twenty two thousand views just under six hundred comments and Arthur more instant is very alarmed posting in all caps the military must take control and force access to these monsters and should be executed on site without mercy [ __ ] kill him Arthur your brain might not work too good but your hearts in the right place just get those kid huh okay now go cook him cook em uh Romney Sagna has some answers posting Catholic people too much adore their church leaders than God Pope Bishop fathers etc that is why this happens mostly to them okay I get it wrong a Catholic children are being abducted raped hunted killed and then their dicks are being mounted in royal trophy rooms because God is mad at their parents what a fun God what a fun God to worship some monster open this guy going get those fat [ __ ] God command you Jim [ __ ] kids Hunnam Thunder sons it cut our dicks off that's some dust shoulder to have her mother statue oh I'm dyin god this is how I do things uh Helen Matthias posts I can't read those horrific documents already saw pizza gate awesome Helen you've fallen for at least two nonsensical conspiracies let's put you in charge some you seem really good again to the bottom of facts Eric Sato does his best to ask an intelligent question writing I was wondering why this exposed video never broadcast in the news or is a block news to avoid revealing their demonic activity I'll answer that interestingly worded question Eric it's never been exposed the news because it's [ __ ] nonces perpetuated by easily manipulated people with the critical thinking abilities of five-year-olds you know you know what I'll forget what I said last week I think we should stop vaccinating I think it might be time to thin the herd out a little bit almost every comment has likes and replies but not impartial Ted's comment mm-hmm radio silence when he posts something a little bit logical posting links to court Docs and signed witness testimony I can't seem to find any trace of that listen up Ted we're trying to have some fun here okay we're trying to get good and worked up over some baseless accusations of rampant satanic molestation murder and kid huntin and you're taking a bit o stead the wagons it'll punch boy goddamn logic [ __ ] police jo Josep of the jungle it's not surprised by the ninth circle cult at all he thinks people have been hunting and [ __ ] and eating kids since the beginning humankind posting this has always went on went on with the Mayans Egyptians and Romans it's never stopped what a strange thing to believe in that people in power I just always just wanted to rape and kill kids just you know what they do what if Joe Joe thinks this like also applies to the business world like basically does everyone with a lot of ambition is that why they're trying to get you know some extra money it's like you just [ __ ] eat those kids so what CEOs are up to yeah what a terrible way to go through life just looking at people with that kind of suspicion uh-huh Congrats on your pizza shop mark must be nice owning a business screwing some money away it must be nice baking that young sexy pizza hide putting your putting your cheese in it uh-huh putting your meat in that tight young pizza I know what you're doing saying puppet but a hundred comments down I find the first comment who seems to think this videos as dumb as I do Giovanni Cruz post I saw this movie the purge is good exactly this conspiracy would make a good movie and I'll end on this idiot unhhhh hairstylist 18 post your logo at the beginning made me turn this off looks like you are working for them all caps my god the logo they're referring to what's the Eye of Providence that Illuminati eye which is actually Christian and origin I've talked about that before it initially represented the eye of God watching over humanity that's its true origin but now so many people are so [ __ ] paranoid and just to be really blunt not smart I don't know why don't they just you know didn't they just chose not to pay attention in school or they just weren't starting with a lot of gray matter to work with in the beginning and then they chose not to kind of beef that up at all they're just so conspiracy obsessed that they see satanic symbols in everything even in Christian iconography included in videos made by people who are on their side like their paranoia is leading them to turn on themselves I love they're starting to cannibalize themselves hopefully this contains hold it is fold in on themselves and there's all this conspiracy talk on the web just devolves into just them constantly sniping and bickering at each other the internet holy [ __ ] there is no shortage of scary morons out there [Music] so now we know the ninth circle cold is not real but now let's look into why certain people are able to believe it's true I did again I do think a lot of people just choose to believe this stuff because they're just [ __ ] loonies but there is you know some some basis for some of the aspects of this concern this fear about this cold fears of systemic underground child abuse you know have run throughout profit or conspiracy theories for centuries it's a thing people have believed over and over again for a long time one of the oldest held beliefs regarding rampant pedophilia and rings of pedophilia is you know about the Jewish people that you know all of them you know won't want to do this murder and Christian children drinking their blood we've touched on this several times in previous sucks you know there's stories that run back deep into the dark ages but a lot of Christians being very scared about what the Jewish people are up to with their kids you know documentation going back at least as far as the 12 century if not far earlier lots of examples of Jewish people being accused killed over baseless accusations you know over things like satanic child sacrifice and why does this happen well because Christianity time and time again has demonized the Jewish people as being the killers of Christ and I know I know the overwhelming majority of Christians do not you know push that kind of worldview they don't focus on that it's an overly vocal minority who spread this incredibly ignorant stupid hate 2,000 years later the shit's still going on in a lot of backwoods fringe Christian circles just last week Jewish comedian Sarah Silverman was it was addressing death rate death threats on social media she's been receiving death threats because a Florida pastor called for her death because she's Jewish in a video that I watched a pastor Adam fan of the steadfast Baptist Church he just recently you know and in Florida said on video you know these Jewish false prophets anti-christian anti-god they're willing to put Jesus to death again you heard this comedian Sarah Silverman listen she is a witch she is a Jezebel she is a God hating whorls I anism I hope that God breaks her teeth out and she dies she is a wicked person she is like the perfect representation of religious Judaism she is Satan's gofer she is there to take the world and make them laugh and then disk Jesus try to take away the respect from Jesus hey Adam how much you [ __ ] kill yourself [ __ ] you Adam fan and you piece of [ __ ] masquerading as a man of God [ __ ] I hate you people so much my least favorite people on earth those who pretend to be holier than thou and you just want to [ __ ] put other people to death because they have different belief systems than you that aren't getting anybody hurt yeah I want to put pedophiles to death because they're [ __ ] predators and you're a predator you're a predator Adam my god man goddess she fires me up and these accusations by the way about Jewish people you know and it being you know these evil satanic you know influenced horrible people trying to like do horrible things to kids never been proven to be true how crazy is that try to find one example of a Jewish pedophile ring you won't cuz there hasn't been one [ __ ] ever not one time there have been Jewish pedophiles there has never been a Jewish pedophile ring and they were certainly never been a Jewish satanic pedophile there's never been a satanic pedophile ring ever I'm gonna address that later the Stephon but it's rampant on the Internet these claims of this [ __ ] uh yeah ironically no one has done more evil [ __ ] to Christian kids and Christians themselves and that's not a knock on Christianity but it is the truth right see Catholic Church pedophile scandals see the people running the Catholic Church they have [ __ ] more kids than any supposed Satanists in the 1980s as we discussed in a few previous sucks especially the Mandela effect sucked 31 America was gripped by another satanic panic and these satanic panics have gone on since like the first century CE parents became convinced that their daycare centers such as the McMartin preschool in Manhattan Beach California filled with Satanists always this it's always the same story filled with Satan's ritually abusing their children there were allegations in the McMartin trial of children being sodomized and secret underground tunnels their captors drank blood in front of them and staged satanic ritual sacrifices witches literally flew around on literal broom kids were flushed down fake toilets into underground [ __ ] dungeons I mean this [ __ ] was talked about in court by grown-ups taking it seriously because they're [ __ ] in certain ways morons superstitious morons that trial was a modern-day Salem witch hunt no evidence of anything ruined a lot of lives you know some paranoid investigators creating false memories harming innocent kids psychologically putting a lot of innocent people in prison you know people who had their careers destroyed the 1999 film Eyes Wide Shut that depicts a fictional secret society right conducting a cult-like sexual ceremony spawned that spawned fevered speculation that you know that the director Stanley Kubrick was just you know trying to expose some real stuff going on I he's just alluding to like people cite that movie now there's an example of like huh they're showing you what goes on and a Merlin the author of Republic of Lies American conspiracy theorists and they're surprising rise to power she says that allegations of pedophilia are central to some of the most widely circulated conspiracy theories on y'know today which they are and she attributes this in part to the simple horror of the crime if someone is abusing children there is no worse of a thing to be she also adds the conspiracies tend to weave their narratives in ways that conveniently implicate their political enemies while sparing their allies which I find hilarious right funny how people like with Epstein this recent thing a lot of memes going around by people on the left you know acting like Trump was clearly behind it and then a lot of other memes by people on the right acting like the Clintons behind it you know even though both Trump and Clinton spend a lot of time with Epstein so it's funny how someone who conservatively could have [ __ ] Clintons is like no no no no no no Trump also tied just as closely to Epstein and then same thing people in left me like haha Trump be buggin here with his friend as well as many liberals as it's uh yeah people just they see what they want to see a lot of times if you're gonna throw out guilty by association then you guys throw out all associates not just the ones who aren't in your political team Merlyn also adds conspiracy theories aren't based on nothing right saying that with every new pedophile arrest with every new me to allegation convictions deepen amongst the true believers saying any sort of sexual abuse scandal that involves powerful people is taken as proof of their basic thesis it's sort of a sad reality that the world is so full of rape and sexual abuse and predation of women and children that it's possible to think this is real again the Jeffrey Epstein case good example of something really horrible this seems to be entirely true as we'll see in a bit and then the reality of like the Epstein case will give fuel to fake stories like the ninth circle cult so let's look into some real evil [ __ ] that makes other not real evil [ __ ] seem way too plausible things that allow the imaginations of others to ramp up to ninth circle cult levels we'll start by taking a peek at some of the worst pedophiles who have ever walked the earth well Bradley first up this guy I think top five it's just a little snippet about him here but top five rage level out of everyone we talked about talking about this guy get ready for your skin to crawl get ready to want to punch holes in the walls around you Earl Bradley is considered by many to be the worst pedophile in American history after what I've read about him I have to agree Earl Bryan Bradley former pediatrician from Lowe's or Lou's Delaware convicted serial child molester terrifying example of evil hiding in plain sight and while he wasn't part of a pedophile ring or a member of some kind of cult what he did was so [ __ ] evil I could see how others could use the reality of what he did to justify suspicions of others organizing to do more of the same Earl Bradley was indicted in 2010 on 471 charges of molesting raping and exploiting a hundred and three child patients 102 girls one boy some of the victims were as young as three months old yeah and the real victim count likely much much higher Bradley is thought to have molested over 1200 children before he went to jail in 2009 in one instance 15 years before his arrest dr. Bradley was caught in the act but still got away with it what the hell are you doing you bastard his patient's mother screamed when she found Bradley with his hand in her daughter's diaper in the process of molesting her trailing the mother to the parking lot Bradley insisted she hadn't seen what she thought she saw the police were called Bradley had been literally caught in the act but did not get in trouble Bradley told the police that the mother who was poor young and unwed was trying to extort money from him and I worked a detective wrote that compared to the doctor the mother was not credible a Medical Board investigator found that Bradley specialized in welfare patients so a shakedown was a distinct possibility the case was closed the son of a [ __ ] man preyed on the poor the doctor went on to become one of the nation's most prolific sexual predators for 15 more years earl bradley raped molested sodomized a generation of pediatric patients along the Delaware seashore he recorded 13 hours that were found 13 hours of assault on video then this is even tougher to hear that everything I've said so far some of the assaults so violent he had to resuscitate the victims to continue because they would lose consciousness and he would wake them back up to continue to sexually assault them and this happened while their parents waited in the lobby for their child to be done with a doctor's visit this [ __ ] I know I sound crazy sometimes I say this if you gave if if I wasn't gonna go to jail for doing it I would curb stomp him to death today if there if they would let me in the cell to just stomp his [ __ ] skull into oblivion I swear to God I would do that and have a [ __ ] smile on my face this piece of [ __ ] currently incarcerated the cheshire Correctional Institution Chet's our Connecticut anytime sucker is currently incarcerated there if you you know happen to accidentally brutally murder this pile of walking garbage please send in a time sucker update so I can read about your heroism and share it with the world be pretty fun to hear about how he accidentally slipped in the shower fell on a knife that somehow cut his dick off and then got accidentally jammed up his ass and then he bled out and died what a terrible accident that would be and I had to stop looking into court details in this guy cuz he just makes me want to scream with rage and also cry and feel sick Earl Bradley living monster surely hope he dies suffering some of the pain he inflicted on his many victims real example doing something you know almost as evil is what the fake members of the fake ninth circle cult were accused of next on the list of subhuman garbage is one of the UK's worst pet worst pedophiles Richard Huckle Richard William Huckle was convicted of 71 counts of serious sexual assaults against children while posing as a teacher photographer and devout Christian and Malaysia believe that he molested somewhere near 200 Malaysian children Huckle has been described as Britain's worst ever pedophiles despite being only 28 years old at the time of his arrest on June 6 2016 he was given 22 life sentences with a minimum prison term of 25 years before being eligible to apply for parole how the [ __ ] to someone get 20 to life sentences and then become eligible for parole in 25 years why is the possibility of parole ever given to a dirtbag who's done so much damage this fake Christian posed as an English teacher doing good deeds to gain access to children from poor real Christian families after being caught huckle expressed remorse for his horrific actions or at least pretended to saying I don't want to become a martyr to sex tourism in Malaysia this was all my doing as a consequence of my own immaturity it maturities excuse me sorry was it in maturities is that is that what it was since was since when was being immature synonymous with kid [ __ ] Huckle said in his letter to the court he had completely misjudged the affections I received from his children ah he's not a bad guy he just has a hard time reading the room you know he's just misjudged his misunderstanding he he thought a young kid glanced at him from across the room while playing with some toys on the floor meant that kid wanted his dick in his butt was just a misunderstanding I hope that guy dies too Huckle added that he was influenced by pathetic perverted lust of those who drew me into the dark net that was his fault you know it's bad influences and another example here of giving credibility to the existence of pedophile rings right he was he was lured into this by some mysterious others he was taken in by an underground network of perverts which I do believe exists by the way I just don't think they exist in a robe wearing let's drink kids blood and chance a Satan kind of way more of a loose connection a greasy haired basement dwellers and to be fair also totally normal-looking people scary's ones of all to me who want to [ __ ] kids and take pictures and videos of doing that and then you know share them with other perverts on the on the dark web I do think that type of thing exists because you know there's arrest examples to back that up to make this guy that much more hateable also evidence that Huckle wrote a pedophile manual titled pedophiles in poverty child lover guide as well as pedo points ledger which he details rapes in various sexual acts he admitted 271 child sex offences including multiple rapes against 23 identified shoulder aged between six months and twelve years old six months man ah staining england we're almost done with this speaking of the supposed famous members of the ninth circle conspiracy Reich's is all about people in power deletes one of the most famous pedophiles in the world was British TV personality Jimmy Savile Jimmy Savile sexually abused hundreds of children and women at the height of his fame and did so over the course of six decades and he did despite being extremely well known to the British public for American listeners this would be the equivalent of dick Clarke from American Bandstand being outed as a sex criminal or you know you know Pat Sajak who is not a pedophile no allegations at all against mr. Sajak effort to be very clear he seems nothing less than a fine upstanding citizen investigators believe that the longtime BBC host and radio personality who hosted the enormous E popular long-running music show Top of the Pops for over 20 years preyed on around 500 vulnerable victims as young as two years old what institutions including children who came to visit the BBC's broadcast studios 14 hospitals 20 children's hospitals across England and he got away with it she died on October 21st 2011 at the age of 84 died a free man most of the investigations into his pedophilia came after his death 450 alleged victims ended up contacting the police in the ten weeks right after the investigation was launched after his death UK police described the alleged abuse as abuse on an unprecedented scale and the number of potential victims is staggering because of Savile fame and the alleged protection he received from the BBC his story adds fuel to legends like the ninth circle called conspiracy I mean after all Savile did hang around the royal family he reportedly spent holidays with the Thatcher's was knighted by Queen Elizabeth even given a papal knighthood by pope john paul ii and there have been many other famous folks who have been caught and prosecuted for sex crimes yeah here's a few examples of those remember Jared Fogle the Subway sandwich spokesman in the early 2000s I should see that goobie [ __ ] on TV every day he was a to the subway five-dollar footlongs with OJ Simpson was two Hertz rent-a-car commercials in 2015 law enforcement agents raided his home as part of a child pornography investigation then in August of 2015 Fogle pled guilty to possessing and distributing child pornography and crossing state lines to pay for sex acts with at least two teenage girls he was sentenced to 15 years in prison won't be eligible for parole until 2028 which is way too soon I don't like these because based on you know studies of pedophiles he's probably gonna reoffending he gets out he's only gonna be 51 when he's released he's still gonna have plenty of boners to work with what do you thing he's gonna want to do with those boners sexual videos with children as young as six years old were found on his hard drive six years old also in a series of text messages that were subpoenaed for his trial he talked about sexually abusing children ranging in age from nine to sixteen also texted someone that he would pay big if they could bring him fourteen-year-old girls texted that he was sexually interested in young boys texted that he also craved underage Asian girls I hope for the sake of sparing potential future victims pain he dies before his release or maybe a little bit better dies like right as he's walking out you know so he can serve his full term another famous [ __ ] Machine Riesling the news from multiple sexual abuse allegations that have supposedly gone on for years is r.kelly 1994 Robert Kelly aka R Kelly married now deceased R&B star Alya I'm sorry messing up her name I thought I had it now that I know a li why a H not somebody that I don't I don't think she's on my spot if I play this right now a falsified Cook County marriage certificate listed her ages 18 but she was only 15 at the time I did look into the details on that dug up the marriage certificate which is yeah easily accessible in mine r kelly was 27 and while the age gap wouldn't have been frowned upon in like 1894 very taboo in 1994 r kelly seems to like him young between 1996 2002 kelly was sued by three women claiming he had sex with them when they were underage by another woman claiming she was unknowingly videotaped while having sex with kelly since then an unspecified number of women have threatened to file similar lawsuits in 2003 a videotape was leaked to the Chicago sun-times which allegedly showed Kelly having sex with an underage girl that video was sent to the police and Kelly was indicted on 21 counts of making child pornography each count for a specified sexual act depicted in the tape Kelly's indictment was reduced to 14 counts one of the sexual acts by the way pissin on a girl's face how [ __ ] up is that when you read about this indictment you don't get the feeling the chief that she wanted to be pissed on you get the feeling that our Kelly enjoys sexually degrading young women in 2008 Kelly was found not guilty on all counts jurors said that they were certain that Kelly was the man in the tape but they just couldn't verify that the woman in the tape was underage and now our Kelly is back in court accused of racketeering and the sexual exploitation of children he's been hit with well over 20 different charges in Minneapolis Chicago and Brooklyn he's allegedly sexually exploited at least five underage girls and women since January 19 1999 at 99 in Illinois California New York Connecticut and other locations he allegedly made these girls call him daddy and didn't give them permission to leave their rooms without his say-so never gave a [ __ ] about his music before all this came out I certainly will not be listening now next on the list of shitlords you know our well-known that have done horrible things or at least been accused by a lot of people doing horrible thing director Roman Polanski now Roman Polanski the oscar-winning director behind Rosemary's Baby in the pianist is what you might call the poster child of celebrity sex offenders in 77 Polanski was arrested and charged with statutory rape sodomy and child molestation after allegedly drugging and having sexual relations with a 13 year old girl he was 43 wanna repeat that for any fans of his movies when he was 43 he drugged and anally raped a 13-year old he was charged with rave by use of drugs perversion sodomy lewd and lascivious acts upon a child under 14 and furnishing a controlled substance to a minor and he did not get in any trouble because after showing up in court prosecutors looked at his birth certificate and did realize that he's polish and we do know that Polish people can't be held responsible for crimes they commit because they're just not intellectually capable of understanding concepts like mortals and loss and I do get that I mean putting a Polish person in prison it doesn't make any more sense than like when a dog or like a gerbil or like a goldfish in prison because intellectually you know kind of the same and I am kitty new listener just like taking random shots at my wife's people the polls no Roman took a plea deal plead guilty to unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor under the terms of the plea agreement the court ordered plants key to report to a state prison for a 90 day psychiatric evaluation to determine if he should receive prison time or be given outpatient rehabilitation he was released after 42 days and then while a judge was evaluating whether or not he should be sent to prison some photos surfaced of Roman at Oktoberfest in Germany with his arms around some girls in a flirtatious way and those girls appeared to be very very young when Roman heard he might get prison time now because it's upcoming hearing based on these photos and what the judge was thinking he buys a one-way ticket to England he flees to France a country where he holds citizenship a country that can refuse to extradite citizens to the US and he's been living free and hiding out in Europe ever since and I don't think he feels too bad about what he did if you're still a fan of this guy check this out in 1979 plans he gave a controversial interview with novelist Martin Amis in which discussing his conviction he says if I had killed somebody it wouldn't have had so much appeal to the press you see but [ __ ] you see and the young girls judges want to [ __ ] young girls juries want to [ __ ] young girls everyone wants to [ __ ] young girls this is a quote from this guy from 1979 uh way to rationalize right yeah yeah I did it [ __ ] of course I did what any man would have done you know if they would have been able to lure her into the hot tub and give her some quaaludes and what is your gonna try and demonize me come on we all know that every dude slows down when they cruise by a medicals middle school to check out all that hot sexy young puss that's not criminal that's just Bros being Bros I mean come on come on like every guy in here doesn't jerk off and the bushes in the city park when some sexy-ass junior highers walked by after band practice please dude we can all agree that every 40 something year old dude wants to motorboat some fresh out the box junior high titties if there's grass on the field am i right come on guy Oh top anyone anyone no okay [ __ ] son of a [ __ ] that's gonna be fun when someone pulls that audio out of a context Dan Cummins member of the ninth circle called hiding in plain sight to help provide additional understanding regarding how someone could believe in something like tonight encircled let's look and do some actual pedophile rings one example is the case of boilover dotnet back in 2011 a massive internet pedophile ring with up to 70,000 online members was busted by numerous law enforcement agencies working together the bust was part of Operation Rescue identified 670 suspects and 230 abuse children in over 30 countries a hundred eighty-four people were arrested that really happened unfortunately this now gets portrayed fictitiously online now the story is presented as if it's happening as if it's just going on the operations still going on the suspects are incorrectly identified as global elites there's you know rumors of satanic overtones which there wasn't and the investigation is listed as ongoing which is not no it's just a bunch of regular old pervs sharing naked photos of kids online and they got caught they weren't European Royals no babies blood was being drank no-one was sacrificed to the devil Operation Rescue was a joint effort involving the European Union Union Agency for law enforcement cooperation Europol and law enforcement in 13 different countries initiated in 2007 ended in 2011 another online pedo ring was busted just as past May 15 children were rescued nine people were arrested in Thailand Australia in the u.s. after an Interpol investigation that began in 2007 teen 2017 excuse me concluded in May now the investigation focused on a hidden dark web site with 63 thousand online users way too many creeps operation black wrists was launched by Interpol after detected images showing 11 different boys aged under 13 being abused on a site where people could use encrypted software to maintain secrecy and watch also operation black wrists seriously this is kind of a jerk off reference but yeah so that's that was busted pizza gate another example of a pedophile ring being uh you know busted except it wasn't blessed because it wasn't real that's actually example of a fake pedophile ring if you don't believe me go back and listen in time size 64 did an entire suck on pizza gate it's no more credible than the ninth circle cult it's really not while pizza gate in the ninth circle cult are not real sex trafficking is real right and you can bet there are rings of sex traffickers in the sense that some groups of people are working together to kidnap other people including kids seldom to other groups who sexually exploit them for profit no robes no promises made to the Dark Lord but still very disturbing here are some disturbing sex trafficking stats in September 2017 the International labor labor organization ILO estimated that twenty four point nine million men women and children were the victims of human trafficking around the globe twenty five million in the year while trafficking victims can be individuals of both genders the majority of victims are women and girls and according to data from the UN fifty-one percent of victims are women while another twenty percent are girls accounting for 71 percent of victims also according the UN's Office on Drugs and Crime 2016 global report on trafficking 54% of all trafficking victims in 2014 were trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation so you can't combine that with the tooth out 2017 numbers you can get like a rough estimate of you know 12 13 million meat sacks mostly women and girls you know being sex trafficked just in one year although there were no other official numbers or estimates regarding the number of human trafficking victims in the US Polaris a non-profit working to combat modern-day slavery and human trafficking says they saw 13 percent jump in identified cases from 2016 to 2017 and this organization believes the overall number of human trafficking victims in just the u.s. is in the hundreds of thousands hundreds of thousands of people and with all these cases for sure comes different type different types of sex rings and we can spend hours talking about them all that's not necessary to illustrate the point that irrational fears regarding fictitious child predators are likely at least partially based on real examples of lots of child predators so let's now look at two final examples of real groups of people engaged in widespread pedophilia the first will be the Catholic Church because no giant organization has come even close to producing as many pedophilia arrests as a Catholic Church after that we'll look at current news stories you know generating a significant amount of concern about pedo rings all these news stories you know talking about the case of Jeffrey Epstein we'll do a little time-suck timeline in each of those before we examine the history of the Catholic Church's own priests and atrocities towards children let's by illustrating is how powerful the Catholic Church is because this you know Stokes fears of a powerful organization hiding people and doing horrible things to kids because that it is what happened maybe this is why the Pope and the Jesuits are woven into the ninth circle called lore right uh the Catholic Church huge powerful kind of secret lots of rituals definitely had lots of pedophiles in the ranks it's impossible to tell how just how wealthy the Catholic Church is the organization's just too big too old to spread out around the globe their finances are too hidden but an article in Times magazine came out way back in 1965 said that after you know journalists did some an investigating the Vatican's wealth was thought to be somewhere between 10 and 15 billion and that would be equivalent anywhere from 80 to 120 billion dollars today and that's basing you know the increasing value just using an inflation calculator but since a lot of their Wells has been tied up and you know some of the best real estate in the world and the price of property has grown faster than the rate of inflation in much of the world I mean their true value as a worldwide organization could be considerably higher than 120 billion dollars so safe to say they're [ __ ] loaded I mean that amount of wealth could theoretically pay for covering up a lot of terrible things according to Forbes magazine Pope Francis is considered the sixth most powerful person in the world the human voice of the Catholic God you know ranks you know right up there with leaders of China Russia the US Germany Jeff Bezos of Amazon the Catholic Church very powerful make sense the people to worry about the Pope historically a lot of very powerful people have done terrible things historically the Catholic Church has done a lot of terrible things yeah so I can see how you know stories that come out about the Catholic Church can feed into the ninth circle or let's take a look at the history of pedophile priests and today's first times like timeline but keep in mind as we go through here that many many instances of abuse you know despite all these instances the vast majority of priests I feel obligated to point out have never been accused of being pedophiles so to be fair to the Catholic Church okay now let's get into this timeline after a word from today's final sponsor what's the easiest way to ease back

now strap on those boots soldier we're marching down a time soccer timeline in his book sex priests and secret codes Reverend Tom Doyle traces the history of clergy sexual abuse of children all the way back to 98 AD maybe it happened back then maybe didn't Doyle doesn't give a lot of any real details about that first alleged incident but there are a lot of details about much more recent incidents 1947 the servants of the para Paraclete opens in Jimmy Springs New Mexico as a treatment center for priests accused of molesting children founded by Reverend Gerald Fitzgerald was a great name Gerald Fitzgerald that's almost as bad at Donald McRonald and that's when you know your organization is real problem by the way when you have a full-time retreat center set up specifically for child molesters I wish I could have chosen how to decorate and run that retreat and transemployees right in the lobby I would had a big old welcome sign you know like right when you walked in just welcome dirt bags please stop [ __ ] kids it's very wrong and then I'd have every employee working they're trained to reinforce that message like you know like when they checked in the front desk er could be like let me get a key for your room just one key correct I mean you should only need one key since no one else is uh you know listed on your reservation especially not any kids that you probably I and [ __ ] if they were right I mean that's correct which is the one key just one key for you that you're not gonna use to be clear to bring kids back to your room to [ __ ] are you just want to make sure that you're aware that that's very wrong it's not okay to do on any level and then those guys when those priests we go to like a restaurant you know I'd have the waiter say stuff like we'd like to hear about today's specials our soup today is a nice clam chowder and it's made fresh from scratch and during the cooking process not a single kid is [ __ ] or molested isn't that nice don't you think that's a good way to make chowder without [ __ ] molesting kids we also have a nice filet mignon on the menu that is never touch the little boy's balls or Buttle don't you think that's a nice way to prepare a steak by not letting it touch the little boy's blood Horrible's I'll say it probably should be touched you know by our chefs from behind by you priest don't don't you think it's very wrong now I'm just kidding I I wouldn't have anybody training to that if I was in charge they would just walk in and there'd be a trap door and they would just fall into a [ __ ] pit of ferocious right welcome kid day learning eating next problem 1984 Reverend Jill Baer Gotha priest the Diocese of Lafayette Louisiana is indicted on 34 counts of sex crimes against children he's the first priest in the u.s. to face a criminal trial for child sexual abuse in October 86 he pleads guilty since 20 years in prison ultimately serving only nine years that's [ __ ] up 34 kids right you messed with an you get 9 years and yet there's still people in prison you know for life in some instances for doing [ __ ] like related to like weed to marijuana distributions [ __ ] June of 1985 Reverend Thomas Doyle Goss attorney ray Moulton released a report called the problem of sexual molestation by Roman Catholic clergy meeting the problem in a comprehensive and responsible manner in the report Doyle warns Bush bishops of the dangers that exist in the church and outlines how sexual abuse allegations should be handled Doyle said that church leaders dismissed his report told him they already knew everything and that they were already you know had some policies in place for dealing with sexual abuse policies that clearly were not working their policy was just like ignore it and hide it in July 1997 a Dallas jury awarded a landmark 119 million dollar judgment against the Catholic Church the largest ever to 11 survivors of clergy sexual abuse after the trial attorney Sylvia de maras says I hope this wakes up the Pope it doesn't the Pope responded with an official statement just writing worth it 10 out of 10 would [ __ ] again so not cool you know I would be seriously not cool if that happened can you imagine the outrage if you know like there was a legate like with modern allegations if people are tweeting the Pope and he just tweets back worth it January 2002 the Boston Globe releases a groundbreaking story that the church allowed a Boston priest known for molesting boys to transfer in and out of parishes where he continued to molest more boys rather than remove him from the ministry so [ __ ] up they knew they knew who he was what he was doing and just let him continue to be a predator some Shepherds some Shepherds those Boston area bishops were June of 2002 after meeting in Dallas Texas the Conference of Catholic Bishops establishes the Charter for the protection of children and young people commonly known as the Dallas charter which calls for zero tolerance for priests who sexually abused children does not however address Catholic Bishops who cover up cases or allow abusive priests to continue in ministry which was a serious problem in March of 2009 New Hampshire named 27 priests accused of abuse after the Attorney General's Office completed a five-year audit of the Diocese of Manchester my god Pope Francis meets with clergy a sexual abuse survivors and promises zero tolerance for priests to abuse children in July of 2014 the movie spotlight is released in the September of 2015 the award-winning film follows how the Boston Globe's investigated a spotlight team uncovered the Catholic Church hiding sexual abuse within the archdiocese or Diocese of Boston I did see that movie powerful excellent movie would not change a thing about it 3 out of 5 stars one of the broadest inquiries into clergy sexual abuse in US history happened in August 2000 a teen a Pennsylvania grand jury released a report concluding that 300 Pennsylvania Catholic priests sexually abused over a thousand child victims over seven decades it's just rent it was epidemic in December of 2018 Pope Francis calls for all priests who have raped molested children to turn themselves in right I'm sure that I'm sure that really helped hey guys stop it and tell us who you are that always works the Pope promises the church will never again cover up clergy sexual abuse and then a picture reveals that his fingers across behind his back when he said that you know and of course that's not true but I don't believe him pure speculation but I think the Catholic Church probably still is hiding some pedophile says there's too much money to lose when they get caught the lawsuits are too big still in December of 2018 the Illinois Attorney General releases preliminary findings in an investigation that revealed the state's six dioceses because they say that failed to disclose sexual abuse allegations against 500 additional priests and clergy members in January of 2019 u.s. Catholic Bishops gather in Illinois for a week-long retreat of prayer and reflection related to the clergy sexual abuse crisis that's that's cute guys that's sweet but uh I don't think you get to get to pray kid [ __ ] away I'm pretty sure execution works but you know I don't think prayer does hard to stick anything in the kids anywhere if you're dead but I don't think anyone has ever been about to mostly kid and then they're just like nah and then you know turns out somebody was praying for them to not do that February 2019 the world's Catholic Bishops gather in the Vatican with the Pope to discuss preventing priests sex abuse they collectively decide that you know it's bad and they should probably call the police I mean you find a creep good job guys good way to brainstorm way to solve that super not complicate a problem and that is it for the first time line of today good job soldier so yeah a lot of a lot of kiddie fiddling and diddlin amongst the supposed to be supposed to be celibate priests of the Catholic Church again most priests you know don't seem to be interested in [ __ ] kids at all but a lot of priests have abused their position of trust have been protected by the church which then makes they believe and you know the possibility of secretive groups of pedophiles not seem so crazy because there is a precedent although a lot of information is hidden sealed in various records and court documents around the world here's a few estimates of the damage caused collectively by the church's leaders there are over four hundred and ten thousand Catholic priests around the world according to the Catholic News Service a Church Commission report in 2004 said more than four thousand us Roman Catholic priests had faced sexual abuse allegations in the last 50 years in cases involving more than ten thousand children mostly boys a 2009 report found that sexual and psychological abuse was endemic in Catholic run industrial schools and orphanages in Ireland for most of the 20th century now extra said man some poor kid in an orphanage already you know doesn't have parents in the world and then just get molested by someone who's supposed to be giving him spiritual guidance a five year Australian inquiry in 2017 found that tens of thousands of children were sexually abused in Australian institutions over decades including churches schools and sports clubs finally the church has paid out more than three billion dollars so far to settle sexual abuse claims that's a lot of sexual abuse okay now let's talk about another possibly if not probably very real pedophile ring the one that orbited around the late Jeffrey Epstein his life may have ended just over a week ago on August 10th but his story is far from over still unraveling probably will continue to unravel for quite some time again not not a tale of dudes and cloaks sacrificed anyone to Satan or drinking baby's blood but a super rich slimy dude taking other dudes rich and powerful dudes you know under you know jet jet trips where are their [ __ ] teen girls in the plane or [ __ ] him on his private island and then using evidence of these illegal acts these dudes just committed to leverage financial opportunities for himself you know if all of this has happened which it seems to have have happened pretty evil not quite the horror movie tale that the ninth circle cult is but still real bad and we're gonna can do a time-suck timeline timeline Epstein as well after he spent a little time kind of laying out some non chronological Epstein info who was he Epstein started his career in New York City as a math teacher at the elite Dalton school but in the 1970s he went to work with investment banker a Bear Stearns before founding his own firm J Epstein & Co in 1982 according to Vox he specifically marketed his services to those with assets worth more than a billion dollars so you know global elite operate his company out of the US Virgin Islands for tax reasons in 2018 Epstein pleaded guilty to a felony charge of solicitation of prostitution involving a minor was sent to 18 months in prison served only 13 granted work release which allowed him to commute to an office outside the jail six days a week he did have to register as a sex offender but since this you know [ __ ] owned his own Island it's not like a to notify neighbors you know about who he was in addition to being a pedophile Epstein was also a philanthropist which put him in regular favorable contact with a variety of powerful and influential people called elites one of the many causes to which Epstein donated you know or of excuse me of the many causes to which Epstein donated academic scientists for a notable group the New York Times reported that he apparently dangled financing for their pet projects in front of them attracted a distinguished group of acquaintances including several Nobel laureates to his home for parties and to scientific conferences that he sponsored also allegedly pressured a variety of underage girls to sleep with any of these scientists who else hung out with Epstein a lot of politicians Epstein associated politicians on both sides of the aisle when I hit that note again both sides come from somebody stand in the middle you know including presidents Bill Clinton and Donald Trump's name just to I've known Jeff for 15 years terrific guy Trump told New York magazine in 2002 he's a lot of fun to be with it has even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do and many of them are on the younger side okay following the news of his recent arrest Trump said he has distanced himself with Epstein in recent years saying I had a falling-out with him I haven't spoken him in 15 years I was not a fan of his that I can tell you that reports the president Trump banned Epstein from one or all of his clubs following his conviction back in 2008 former President Bill Clinton issued a public statement recently acknowledging that he is written on F Singh's private plane but that he was unaware of Epstein's criminal activity as he a Clinton spokesperson said President Clinton knows nothing about the terrible crime Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty to in Florida some years ago or those with which he has been recently charged in New York in 2002 and 2003 President Clinton took a total of four trips on Jeffrey Epstein's airplane one to Europe one to Asia and two to Africa which included stops in connection with the work of the Clinton Foundation there are some conspiracy theories claiming now that Trump had Epstein killed to keep from getting named Ramstein as a pedophile and a lot more conspiracy theories claiming that the Clintons had Epstein killed to keep him from naming Bill or Bill and Hillary as pedophiles for the record there is thus far zero evidence linking either Trump or the Clintons to having sex with anyone related to the Epstein case none of the accusers and they've accused many people none of them you know in the Epstein case have accused Trump or Clinton's you know or Bill Clinton the Clintons as people that Epstein or his assistant ghilane max will pressure them into having sex with could that change yes it could but again no evidence so far despite what Kevin D Annette and Randi shocked and Judy Byington and those types like to say on reddit or post and YouTube common threads they are just just talking out their asses at one point Epstein also Lee also notably had ties to Queen Elizabeth's son Prince Andrew the extent of the relationship is somewhat unclear but they were spotted walking together in Central Park in late 2010 and at that point in time Epstein was already convicted sex offender so you know best case poor judgment poor choice for Prince Andrew to hang out with him now let's talk about his recent arrest Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey last month July 6 after arriving back in the u.s. from France he was charged by federal prosecutors the following Monday and then pled not guilty federal prosecutors also searched his New York City home phone his arrest according to the New York Times during the search of his townhouse investigators seized photographs of nude underage girls according to The Daily Beast prosecutors wrote the following and a memo requesting Epstein be jailed until his trial the defendant a registered sex offender is not reformed he has not chastened he is not repentant rather he is a continuing danger to the community and an individual who faces devastating evidence supporting deeply serious charges prosecutors said the case would involve a million pages of discovery including evidence from his Manhattan mansion they wanted the trial to begin next June prosecutors thought the trial would have lasted four to six weeks on July 18th Epstein was denied bail he had previously said he was willing to post a hundred million dollars per the New York Times prosecutors argued that mr. Epstein's vast wealth said to be more than five hundred million would make it possible for him to flee the country if he were not held in jail NBC News reported that judge Berman said I doubt any bail package can overcome any danger to the community on July 24th Epstein was reportedly found injured in his cell though it was unclear initially what happened to him it was soon apparent that it was a suicide attempt and he was put on a suicide watch and then he was you know in jail and he knew that if convicted the charges against him he's gonna face a maximum prison of 45 years let's look at that indictment to see what those charges were exactly there were two charges in the indictment one for sex trafficking one for a sex trafficking conspiracy the indictment accused he defended Jeffrey Epstein of sexually exploiting and abusing dozens of minor girls at his homes in Manhattan New York and Palm Beach Florida among other locations it said in particular from at least in or about 2002 up to and including at least in or about 2005 Jeffrey Epstein the defendant enticed and recruited and caused to be enticed and recruited minor girls to visit his mansion in Manhattan New York and his estate in Palm Beach Florida to engage in sex acts with him after which he would give the victims hundreds of dollars in cash moreover and in order to maintain and increase his supply of victims Epstein also paid certain of his victims to recruit additional girls to be similarly abused by Epstein in this way Epstein recreated a vast network of underage victims for him to sexually exploit in locations including New York and Palm Beach the victims described herein where as young as 14 years old at the time they were abused by Jeffrey Epstein the defendant and were for various reasons often particularly vulnerable to exploitation Epstein intentionally sought out minors and knew that many of his victims were in fact under the age of 18 including because in some instances minor victims expressly told him their age in creating and maintaining this network of minor victims in multiple states to sexually abuse and exploit Jeffrey Epstein the defendant worked and conspired with others including employees and associates who facilitated his conduct by among other things contacting victims and scheduling their sexual encounters with Epstein at the New York residence and at the Palm Beach residence when a victim arrived at the New York residence she typically would be escorted to a room with a massage table where she would perform a massage on Jeffrey Epstein the defendant the victims who were as young as 14 years of age were told by Epstein or other individuals to partially or fully undress before beginning the quote massage during the encounter Epstein would escalate the nature and scope of physical contact with his victim to include among other things sex acts such as groping and direct and indirect contact with the victims genitals F teen typically would also masturbate during these sexualized encounters asked victims to touch him while he masturbated and touch victims genitals with his hands or with sex toys moreover Epstein actively encouraged certain of his victims to recruit additional girls to be similarly sexually abused Epstein incentivized his victims to become recruiters by paying these victim recruiters hundreds of dollars for each girl they brought to him in doing so Epstein maintained a steady supply of new victims to exploit teen sometimes personally contacted victims to schedule by the New York or Anthony or presidents in other instances Epstein directed employees and associates to communicate with victims via phone to arrange for these victims to return to the New York residence for additional sexual encounters with Epstein in addition to recruiting and abusing minor girls in New York Jeffrey Epstein the defendant created a similar network of minor girls to victimize in Palm Beach Florida Epstein frequently traveled from New York to Palm Beach by private jet before which an employer associate would ensure that minor victims were available for encounters upon his arrival in Florida right I mean so all of this I mean it does sound to me like a real-life pedophile ring right when were numerous adults conspire to have an adult engage in sexual activity with minors and and there's other allegations with very long report that you know he wasn't just one of the the only person victimized knees girls he would also you know have business associates people who's trying to impress he would share the girls with them or instruct the girls to sexually satisfy them and some of his associates who were helping him recruit like Maxwell also been accused of victimizing these girls personally so it is very pedophile ring ask I mean I mean not even asking it does seem to be a legitimate pedophile ring one epstein accuser Virginia jew-free has said that Epstein and his sidekick Maxwell directed her to have sex with former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson Britain's Prince Andrew wealthy financier Glenn Dubin former senator George Mitchell now deceased MIT scientists Marvin Minsky modeling agent jean-luc Brunel as well as another Prince a foreign president a well-known prime minister the owner of a large hotel chain in France on and on and on still night still not you know ninth circle cult hunting kids and putting their mounted Nixon trophy rooms but very disturbing high-profile attorney Alan Dershowitz also accused of having sex with underage girls supplied by Epstein and Maxwell and who knows who else may be named in the days weeks and months to come okay so now let's hop into a second timeline to do dig into this a little bit further this timeline comes from the newspaper that broke the case the Miami Herald strap on those boots soldier we're marching down a time soccer timeline [Music] Epstein is born in 1953 I've seen in his younger brother Mark raised by middle-class parents in Brooklyn his father worked for the city's Park department while his adult life would be defined by wealth and decadence his childhood was you know very average middle-class in the late 1960s and early 70s and this is just gonna be you know it's not an Epstein suck so a little bit more of an overview than some timelines the late 60s early 70s Epstein dabbled in college education but never obtained a degree from 1969 to 71 he attended the Cooper Union School of Engineering a spokesman for New York University told reporters that Epstein took classes as a visiting student there from September 71 to June 74 did not take part in a specific degree program New York magazine stated he also attended the Courant School of Mathematics The Huffington Post confirmed that Epstein landed a gig at the elite dalton school a very you know private prestigious School in New York City's Upper East Side in 73 this is an elite K through 12 college prep school where Epstein would have taught the children of some of New York's wealthiest and most powerful and influential people Donald Barr was the headmaster at that school when Epstein was hired Donald is the father of current Attorney General William Barr William Barr refused to recuse himself in the Epstein case before Epstein's death despite this conflict of interests just interesting to note according to you New York magazine in his 2002 profile of Epstein he was something of a Robin Williams in Dead Poets Society type of figure Wow in his high school classes with passionate mathematical risks former Dalton teacher students and parents contacted by Huffington Post Rebecca Klein had varied memories of the young instructor some not remembering him at all some remembering noticing red flags in his behavior early on way back then where he seemed a little too chummy little too flirty with some of the teen girls others simply recalled the eye-catching fur Cody liked to wear 1976 Epstein left Dalton according to New York and Vanity Fair after his students father urged him to pursue a career on Wall Street he then spent a few years as a trader at a now-defunct investment bank where he you know used his considerable mathematical skill and charisma and sales abilities and networking abilities to have a rapid ascent to the top of this an investment bank he's now not teaching math to the children New York City's rich and powerful he's using math to make you know these people a lot of [ __ ] money and become real chummy with him he starts to become pretty rich himself in 1982 Epstein forms his own investment company Jay Epstein and Co not sure if that company still operational or not after his death I can't locate a website for them maybe they never had one they were pretty exclusive the company claimed to give services to individuals and families with a billion or more to manage if you wanted to work with them wanted to work with epsteen epsteen would take control of the billion plus dollars charge a flat fee assume power of attorney to do whatever he thought was necessary to do to advance his clients financial costs Lex or less scuse me less Wexner founder of underwear maker L brands which includes companies like Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works one of F's teens clients sometime in the 90s Epstein purchased a secluded compound in Palm Beach Florida where does it allege the Epstein sexually abused many underage girls for money 1996 Epstein relocated his company to the US Virgin Islands renamed his company that a financial trust Co the relocation was reportedly made for tax purposes in 2002 New York reported that the company consisted of a hundred and fifty purely administrative employees public information about the operation hard to find including a list of clients Epstein loved to work in secret and he was very good at it in the digital age hard to find info about a lot of this stuff online in the late nineties Epstein moved into a Manhattan mansion that is one of the most expensive pieces of real estate in all of New York City its value estimated at anywhere from 56 to 77 million dollars for one private residence in Manhattan how Epstein required this mansion remains a mystery the New York Times reported Epstein declared it to be his property in a 1996 interview according to Bloomberg which cited one anonymous source familiar with the matter Epstein client lez you know Victoria's Secret Wexner sold a home in 1998 to a company affiliated with Epstein public records show the title transfer was not made until 2011 and when it was made made for no money very strange no substantiation of these rumors but a lot of people speculate that Epstein had some dirt on Wexner and blackmailed Wexner into giving him that home again no proof of that but a lot of speculation about it several of Epstein's accusers say the mansion is where he sexually assaulted them and the mansion's decor very nine circle esque has around 40 rooms decorated was chemica maze-like setup decorated with stuff like body parts sculptures huge and haunting self-portrait of Epstein a life-sized female doll hanging from a chandelier when you walk in you are Grodin with greeted greeted with quote row upon row of individually framed eyeballs imported from England oh alright ah as I say that I'm like this [ __ ] crazy I'm thinking about I got pictures of serial killers all over the stuck dungeon walls it's a little it's neck look good if I okay according to one visitor who spoke to The Times there's a chessboard at the bottom of a staircase that's more than a little creepy each of the customized figurines on the chess board are modeled after one of Epstein staffers and all of them are dressed sexually suggestive Lee huh I wonder what our Reverend dr. uh horse [ __ ] Johnson Paisley would think if I had a bunch of statues of him around the suck dungeon you know just wearing little speedos maybe maybe one finger in his mouth just suggestively winking ah he probably was Larry's I probably more creeped out than him 1998 Epstein purchases little st. James island and the US Virgin Islands an alarming 1988 report The Associated Press described how people who live in the area surrounding Epstein's extremely private oasis started calling it pedophile island when molestation accusations against him were first made public you know two decades little over two decades ago Epstein hired hundreds of workers to build a stone mansion on the island along with a bizarre temple like structure nearby very colty most of the former employees of Epstein's refused to speak to the Associated Press citing long non-disclosure agreement States signed around 1999 allegedly Epstein forced an underage Merrill agro worker to have sex with Prince Andrew and a lawyer Alan Dershowitz in 2015 Virginia Roberts jew-free said in a sworn affidavit that Maxwell initially approached her while she was working at Merrill agro and offered to provide her with massage training she was then brought to Epstein's Palm Beach mansion where she said Epstein abused her beginning to 1999 when she was 15 she said the abuse continued for several years during which she says she was passed around to other famous men in 2002 Epstein allegedly raped in New York City High School student at his New York mansion in july 2019 in an interview with NBC's Today Show Jennifer arose said she was approached at the age of 14 by a young woman outside her High School in 2001 brought to Epstein's Norma's townhouse mansion for first time and there he would abuse her and pay her money over the following year culminating in what she described as a forcible rape in March of 2005 a fourteen-year-old girl and her parents reported that Jeffrey Epstein molested her at a mansion in Palm Beach she said a female acquaintance and classmate at Royal Palm Beach High School had taken her to a house given him a massage where she'd given him a massage in exchange for money in April of 2005 the Palm Beach Police began doing trash pulls in Epstein's home discovering a telephone message for Epstein with the girl's name on it and a time that matched the time she told police she was there they find the names and phone numbers of other girls on message slips in his trash with the police probe in full swing by October of 2005 one of Epstein's assailants her assistant excuse me calls one of the girls just as she's being questioned by police investigators then began interviewing more girls as well as Epstein's Butler's who tell them that Epstein had frequent visits from girls throughout today on October 20th they execute a search warrant at his house on el brillo Way in Palm Beach in May of 2006 police sign a probable cause affidavit charging Epstein and two of his assistants with multiple counts of unlawful sex acts with a minor the Palm Beach State Attorney Barry Krisher refers the case to a grand jury in June of 2006 the grand jury after hearing from only one girl returns an indictment of one count of solicitation of prostitution the charge does not reflect that the victim in question and others were minors weird in July of 2006 Epstein's powerhouse legal team tries to negotiate a deal with the State Attorney's Office lawyers discuss a deferred prosecution which Epstein would enter a pre-trial intervention program and serve no jail time in July again after pressure from the Palm Beach police chief the FBI opens a federal investigation dubbed Operation leap year documents listing possible crime is child prostitution by November the FBI begins interviewing potential witnesses victims from Florida New York and New Mexico in May of 2007 as the US Attorney's Office prepares to present the case to a federal grand jury Epstein's attorneys request a meeting to discuss investigation in September of 2007 federal prosecutors dropped several federal plea agreements that are rejected by Epstein and his attorneys Epstein signs a non-prosecution agreement on September 24th but his attorneys continued to delay a court appearance with the non-prosecution agreement still being delayed or delayed excuse me tober of 2007 Acosta meets Epstein lawyer meets with Epstein lawyer J leaf quits at the West Palm Beach Marriott on Okeechobee Boulevard to discuss finalizing a deal among the terms agreed upon that the victims would not be notified that the deal would be kept under seal and all grand jury subpoenas would be cancelled very suspicious everything being hidden Epstein attorney leaf Kuwait's calls Acosta in January of 2008 telling him his client will not go through with the agreement because it requires him to register as a sex offender when the plea negotiations and the Justice Department review still in limbo in February the FBI continues his probe locating more witnesses located more evidence in March of o8 preparations are made for a new federal grand jury presentation in court documents the US Attorney's Office notifies that are notes that Epstein's victims are being harassed by his lawyers who are not specifically named then in made the Justice Department issues findings that if a plea deal cannot be reached Epstein can be federally prosecuted then in June Epstein's lawyers revisit plea negotiations and on June 30 2006 Epstein appears finally in a Palm Beach County courtroom please guilty to state charges one count of solicitation of prostitution one count of solicitation of prostitutes the minor under the age of 18 sentenced to eight months in jail asterisks followed by a year of community controller house arrests he's adjudicated as a convicted sex offender who must register twice a year in Florida I say the asterisk there because of the place where he stayed this is like a like a country club we got to leave all the time for work then in July of 2008 Epstein's victims learn about his plea in state court after the fact and they filed an emergency petition to force federal prosecutors to comply with the federal crime victims rights act which was violated this act mandates certain rights for crime victims including the right to be informed about plea agreements and the right to appear at sentencing that did not happen Epstein's victims learned that he has already been sent to jail in August's and that the federal investigation is over all right they're still thinking this guy could you know be sentenced her they're waiting to go to court and they're like oh what it's all done we weren't told they seek to have his plea agreement unsealed federal prosecutors argue against releasing the agreement commencing a year-long court battle to learn the terms of his plea bargain and October 8ft begins a work-release program from the county stockade he's picked up by his private driver six days a week transported to an office a luxurious office in West Palm Beach where he accepts visitors for up to 12 hours a day and then returns to the stockade in the evenings to sleep some jail sentence and [ __ ] ridiculous it's a slap in the face to those victims in July of 2009 Epstein is released from the Palm Beach County stockade five months early now he has to register as a sex offender and is on probation for a year combined to his Palm Beach luxury mansion other than when he now has to travel to his office in West Palm Beach however records show he didn't even follow that he frequently made trips to Manhattan and to his home in the US Virgin I didn't do what every [ __ ] wanted in August of 2009 Palm Beach Police Captain George Frick finds Epstein walking along an a.1 a or along a1a in the middle of the afternoon this this road local road here where he's supposed to be at work at his office in downtown West Palm Beach Epstein says he's walking to work even though he's miles away not on a direct route and then his probation officer is notified and says yeah he's eating his keys his kids an exercise so again basically other than he had to spend a couple nights in some kind of country-club Jail where I'm sure he was able to customize his accommodations a murder he had like the finest of pillows the finest of mattresses you know he sleeps there and then just goes on with his life luxury you know I get to [ __ ] the federal non-prosecution agreement is made public in September of 2009 at least a dozen civil lawsuits were filed by women who alleged they were molested by Epstein when they were underage he begins the process of settling with him out of court in November of 2009 one of Epstein's former butler's tries to sell to an undercover FBI agent a black book filled with the names of hundreds of girls and young women that Epstein allegedly procured for sex and massages the butler tells FBI agents he witnessed nude underage girls in Epstein's pool had known that you know multi-multi-millionaire was having sex with them he also said he saw pornography involving underage girls on Epstein's computers the Butler house man Alfredo Rodriguez is later charged himself with his direction of justice and he sends to federal prison [ __ ] really oh my god he dies in 2015 the contents of the black book become public as part of several lawsuits the book has the names addresses phone numbers for every from everyone from Courtney Love to a to former Israeli prime minister a who would Barak to Alec Baldwin and to be fair to those name's Epstein love to show off you know knowing famous people also seem to exaggerate how well he knew those people so you know just because you're in this book doesn't mean you you did anything or even hung out with even one time you could have obtained you know some of these names and numbers from publicist managers that kind of thing in April of 2010 flight logs obtained as part of a civil lawsuit against Epstein show an assortment of politicians academics celebrities heads of state world leaders flying on his jets and the only 2000s among them of course former President Bill Clinton former national security adviser sandy Berger former Colombian President Andrei R andreas Pastrana lawyer Alan Dershowitz actors Chris Tucker Kevin Spacey and many many more November 2011 Epstein had to register in New York as the highest and most dangerous level of sex offender despite efforts by him and the New York District Attorney's Office to lower that classification a level 3 status means high-risk to reappear api-- to fence and a threat to public safety exists calling himself a celebrated philanthropist and a renowned educational investor Epstein undertakes a public relations campaign to counter all the bad press about his sexual exploits from March 2012 through December of that year has found it his foundation donates millions to scientific research sponsored global conferences on ways to achieve world peace and save the planet he funds cancer and educational research projects around the country and in all likelihood [ __ ] a whole bunch high scores January 2015 Virginia Robert Jeffery filed court papers and Florida claiming she was forced by Epstein to have sex with Prince Andrew Alan Dershowitz provided photographs of her with the Prince and with Epstein's close associate British socialite d'Alene Maxwell she claimed Maxwell worked as Epstein's madam which Maxwell denies Dershowitz and the Prince tonight her claims as well of course they do setting off a series of legal actions between Dershowitz and Roberts attorneys or jus for his attorneys that are later resolved in an out-of-court settlement in September of 2015 gia free sues Maxwell in federal court in New York claiming that Epstein's alleged Madame defamed her in public statements in the media the lawsuit is widely viewed as a vessel for Epstein's victims to expose the scope of his crimes several civil lawsuits filed the same year allege Epstein of max will operate an international sex trafficking operation on July 6 2009 teen Epstein arrested at that New York you know New Jersey Airport like we Epstein pleads not guilty and he's gonna face like I said earlier 45 years if convicted on July 11th more than a dozen women who according to their attorneys were previously unknown to law enforcement come forward with sexual abuse accusations against Epstein according to the Miami Herald on July 23rd Epstein found unresponsive in his cell with marks on his neck that suggested he may have attempted suicide he's hospitalized returned to a Cell placed on suicide watch supposed to be monitored rumors swirled that someone or perhaps multiple people want him dead he supposedly came lots of powerful people you know to take down a lot of his old friends with him friends who supposedly also have been having sex with underage girls I worry that he will not live and tell his trial many others worried about this as well you know we think that if he if he does die it's not gonna be a suicide but it's gonna be made to look like a suicide everybody was talking about the exact thing and then at 6:30 a.m. on the morning of August 10th 2019 Epstein despite having been placed again on suicide watch found dead in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center MCC in New York City an autopsy is performed August 11th no cause of death has been announced they are claiming it is highly likely that it is a suicide the New York City Medical Examiner's Office is waiting further information and this death in particular adds a lot of fuel to the fire of conspiracies like the ninth circle cult because it is extremely suspicious it also takes us out of our final time soft timeline good job soldier you've made it back [Music] so FST I can see how his story could lead others to believe in something like the ninth circle cult people knew he molested or raped teens knew for at least two decades he kept getting away with it even when he was found guilty in court he still got away with it why because he was rich and influential and because he had rich and influential friends and then a bunch of evidence comes out about him really running a pedophile ring there's there's a lot of indicators that he got a more than should have been legal favorable deal and his initial arrests you know who is he hiding you know when you hear all that it makes you wonder what else could be going on in the world you know this is what we know about what's going on that we don't know about man all this real-life pedophile [ __ ] it's super heavy super sad to think about all the real acts that pedophilia far too many people have gotten away with so before we we wrap up with some final thoughts let's take a break from real pedophile scandals and have some fun with that fake one again by going back to the ninth circle cult let's go back to that well dip in there one more time with another idiots of the Internet [Music] we got to talk about Kevin and net on this one uh you know after reading about him and looking into some of his books and beliefs I needed to know more ended up watching a few Kevin and that videos this is the mind behind the ninth circle cult conspiracy the guy who thinks if you can figure out magic words you're not bound by nation's laws you know I guess too bad Epstein didn't know those words and he kind of just [ __ ] me like whatever I'm out just walk right out of jail the man this is the man who thinks he overthrew the Canadian government started a country no one else knows about kanata on December 4th 2014 conscience media a YouTube channel based on his content that is dedicated to not have any conscience when it comes to you know presenting gibberish his truth a channel allergic to accurate media published a video called Kevin and net talks about Saturnalia and the ninth circle cult now Saturnalia was an ancient Roman festival is celebrated the god Saturn right Saturday celebrated Saturn in December Saturn the god of wealth agricultural or agriculture my god liberation renewal and more and in this video a video that is painful to listen to Kevin tries to you know tie his made-up ninth circle cult back to the ancient Romans right like it's been going on since the ancient Roman days you know the rich and powerful been casually hunting and [ __ ] kids for you know over two thousand years so he presents his thoughts which are you know what you imagine gia love Bella child buys everything Kevin is selling even add some nonsensical facts of her own to the conspiracy writing here it is 2018 when she posted obviously children across the u.s. are being taken by CPS for no reason at all studies show that eighty percent of CPS children are trafficked the missing numbers for the US are 800,000 per year where China a much more sense population or that means has an average of 15,000 and they still thrive on Haiti [ __ ] what first of all why not all these people right the same way they know right is if they they're barely literate and then and then studies showed that eighty percent of CPS children are trafficked but what [ __ ] studies studies that gia took in her head and then hit in her ass there's no study I can find that even comes close to say dat because children trade smoking not user Rayfield Weisman thinks that Kevin is doing a great job he posts go Kevin you're the best smiley face and then David Aames also thinks that Kevin is doing a great job and David Aames ah seems to be deliciously out of his mind David writes yeah he's also a great Prime Minister we have unanimously elected him to be the new prime minister of kanata he's doing a bang-up job all of his girlfriend's have forgiven him for all of his sins against him he was led by Satan's trapped to date all these girls at the same time but he has gone on the air asking for forgiveness with tears running down his face he has asked everyone for forgiveness it's on YouTube probably on his web site he's working so hard to make everything right what I couldn't find that a video it may exist kevin has so many videos and they're not labeled to correspond with what he talks about necessarily how great is this David guy he thinks that Kevin is doing a great job running a country that's not real who are these people he thinks that Kevin has sufficiently apologized for a scandal that has rocked the fake leadership of a fake country holy [ __ ] this is deep and you know what to me to be honest it does remind me of a little scandal of my own that I've been meaning to address for quite some time I want to speak just real quick to the to the constituents of the taco skater Republic this is the country I created because I like tacos and like spaghetti and I think Republic is a fun word anyway listen you think you're living the United States wake up sheeple you're living in the taco sketti republican right now I need you to set down your schedule and listen to for a sec I want apologize for fake executing my fake vice president the fake Robert McRobert bobert I felt like I had to fake kill him when he faked asked to have some fake sushi added as a fake official food and I got so fake matted at bobert McRobert McDavid mob burped that i told him that he needed to be fed he's executed I was like I'm a [ __ ] fake kill you he's like fake fake don't I like I'll fake will and then you know for you fake Darren to fake suggested fakes do should be one of the fake official food to the fake kind of scared public people uh you know live in a world is similar to one I just threw out there but they're not kidding user Valerie Jones simply posts Kevin email me like this you post this on a video not posted on Kevin's channel and also doesn't include her email address I love it Oh Valerie I don't think you know the internet works I wanna start doing that but like in real life just yell yellow people himself you know just a red lights hey hey yeah you want you email me sometime he's Drive off maybe do that when I leave restaurants thank you everything no everything was great yeah thanks no you have a nice nice night as well thank you very much email me sometime then sleep Samantha Mason has some thoughts she'd like to get out I get the feeling she doesn't have a lot of room in her head for thoughts she writes Jon Benet Christmas Eve she was sacrificed to these were beautiful children tortured and murdered what are these demons living among us are we in hell all caps my favorite part about that post is that it's edited it shows it has been edited somebody proof read that somebody proof read Jon Benet about ten spaces xmas eve about ten spaces she was sacrificed to no punctuation these were beautiful children weird spaces tortured and D murdered weird spaces all caps what are these demons living among us lots of spaces all caps are we in hell finally a question mark that's edited some somebody it wasn't like that originally somebody [ __ ] tweaked it then kind of sat back and goes yeah yeah that's it that's a message I need to get out there click send finally Cindy Lewis has taken Neos red pill she decided to step out of the Illuminati illusion she's outside the matrix she's outside the matrix that surrounds us she doesn't like the real world that she sees now though she rides hi Kevin I can say that within the last year I have been red pilled I have awoken but with mixed emotions thankful all caps for individuals such as yourself fighting for all mankind anger Oh caps knowing this kind of genocides have been going on for centuries all caps sad this info has not been brought forward so all caps all people's around the world were given the truth through news media and not being hidden in the shadow and then finally ending on an all cast crescendo all this should be brought to light over and over until humanity wakes up what a world Sen he lives in always looking over his shoulder always suspicious of evil shadowy forces controlling things always wondering if some kid from the neighborhood yes in a while has been taken by the ninth circle cult always wondering when she last fed her many many semi feral cats always checking her Etsy shop to see how many amethyst protection amulets you can sell him always frustrated she doesn't have enough money to undergo as many psychic readings as she would prefer always viewing the world through her sad paranoid far too common based on what I see on YouTube wackadoodle ends let's get here [Music] so the ninth circle cult obviously it's not real there's there's there's no even quasi legitimate evidence supports that no evidence to support this existence of any satanic pedophile cult ever ever in history is that interesting with all the rumors that are out there try and find one example one incredible example in the entire history of humanity from any country past or present find one example of high-ranking members of society secretly worshipping the devil so you know to [ __ ] torture and sacrifice kid I mean the New York Times published an article on Halloween in 1994 stating that the National Center on child abuse and neglect conducted a study because of all the satanic panic going on at that time conducted a study led by University of California psychologist Gail Goodman which found that amongst 12 thousand separate accusations of satanic ritual abuse there was no evidence for quote a well organized intergenerational satanic cult who sexually molested and tortured children although there was convincing evidence of lone perpetrators or couples who say they are involved with Satan or use the claim to intimidate victims right so couple Kooks out of 12,000 claims you know where people probably somewhat similar we're probably something you know similar to past suck subjects like Richard the nightstalker Ramirez or David Parker ray the toy box killer you know people who just said satanic [ __ ] took to [ __ ] with people or who claimed to be satanic but really just wanted to be perceived as evil you know they Clint like Richard Ramirez claimed to be satanic he was never doing in his prison cell or anywhere else any satanic rituals he wasn't like studying the Satanic Bible he was just a guy who liked to freak Christians out but kids really do get molest in a rape far too often sometimes their attackers do share them with other perpetrators or at least share their pictures with other victimizers and sometimes other adults do help cover up those crimes against children or even worse a system in their quest to harm children and those people are the people we should focus on catching and locking away forever that's what really bothers me about like wackadoodles getting worked up over nonsense I'm not bothered by them getting fired up I'm just mad that they don't direct their outrage towards real worthy targets because there's plenty of those don't waste your I'm on nonsense like the ninth circle cult or pizza gate no direct that rage against real [ __ ] like the Epstein case we're in all likelihood a lot of people really did [ __ ] a lot of kids and are really gonna get away with it these people don't need to wear robes they don't need to drink baby's blood or being some you know cult to be evil evil doesn't have to be cartoonish and in fact I don't think it often is I think it usually shows up looking you know like your neighbor look looking like somebody you know hiding behind a firm handshake and a winning smile how did have seen get away with what he got away with for so long because he didn't seem like a weird saintly dude he seemed like a smart fun guy who's gonna make you a lot of money you know cuz he was that guy unfortunate he was also the guy who's gonna rape 14 year olds day after day when looking for real monsters don't look for cloaks and babies blood don't look for you know dicks mounted on trophy room walls keep your eye on the guy cross the street keep your eye on the dude running the youth group or the swim team coach your goddamn uncle and it is mostly dudes I know as women's do it too but that's why I'm going with the male reference there the sad truth is that if anybody is gonna hurt your kids probably gonna be somebody you know probably gonna be somebody you don't suspect that's what the stats say so don't be paranoid but do be vigilant time now for today's top five takeaways number one there's no ninth circle cult European Royals don't have trophy rooms full of kids dicks number two the ninth circle cult first showed up not at some gated European forest showed up on the computer screen of Kevin D and net the guy who invented a fake International Court the guy currently trying to run a fake North American country number three not one now one satanic pedophile ring has ever actually been uncovered ever in the history of the world sometimes where there's a lot of smoke there is not a fire there was just a lot of wackadoodles bent over blowing smoke out of there paranoid wackadoodle asses number four while the fears of parents and concerned citizens are certainly not based on nothing sex trafficking and pedo rings are all too real the majority of sexual assaults over 90% are committed by someone the child knows usually a family member number five new info despite all the scary [ __ ] we just went over today the rate of sexual assault the rate of rape has actually fallen from sixty-three fallen sixty-three percent since nineteen ninety three that's right the rate of sexual assaults fallen sixty-three percent since nineteen ninety three so despite all the pedo talk going on the news right now maybe just maybe there's less kids a lot less kids being sexually assaulted than there used to be let's hope that trend continues with modern crime solving techniques with more people reporting crimes now than they did in the past because of today's technology because of more law enforcement and social service agencies and organizations being around to make it easier to report perps one of these organizations is rainn.org rai n m org they offer resources and information about sexual abuse you can contact the National Human Trafficking hotline toll free one eight seven eight eight eight if you suspect any human trafficking going on around you I will put that number in the episode description one eight eight eight three seven three seven eight eight eight advocates are available 24/7 to take reports of the death of potential human trafficking so much doctors in the world but maybe a bit less than yesterday hail Nimrod for that let's end on that note because that's about as positive is it's gonna get with today subject take away ninth circle sucks thanks to the time-suck team thanks to Queenie the suck Lindsey Cummins high priest of the suck harmony Bella camp glad she's in CDA Jessie Guardian of grammar doden to Reverend dr. Joe horse [ __ ] Johnson Paisley uh-huh gonna sell that bit elixir axis apparel thanks to Zach script keeper Flannery to all the spaces words who are you know who came to the time said gathering this past Saturday I'll be talking about efforts actually happened in my life next week the first Wild West suck we've had and way too long Jesse James and the james-younger gang yeah yeah Oh doc whoa these band is and outlaws were heroes to many they robbed banks and stagecoaches and trains for two decades and interesting you know criminals to some heroes too many for nearly a decade following the Civil War the james-younger gang was among the most feared most publicized most wanted confederation of outlaws the entire American frontier they were gang number one for quite some time and we're gonna suck them in particular their leader Jesse one of America's most famous outlaws apparently I'm related to several of their gang members as my uncle says apparently in the Commons family tree couple members of the james-younger gang cannot wait to get my prospector voice back out turn around a lot of things there's some shifting whatnot Oh contact might open it'll find out soon now let's get into some serious time sucker updates first a little quick non vaccination update from Robb Schofield who writes you son of a [ __ ] you call yourself a gun guy but you continue to call a magazine a clip stop it love the suck thank you rob yes I've been around guns my whole life I only have one rifle at home right now probably get more soon there's a shooting range right down the street that I'd like to find time to go to and I'll probably still [ __ ] up the term zone because I just I just never get into those details on the same way with trucks I like trucks I Drive a truck I admire other trucks I'm aah my god that's a cool truck but if you ask me what your model of random truck was I'm not gonna know 90% of the time but I will try to get better I love the enthusiasm yeah you a gun lovers have now the first of several vaccination updates the first one comes in from Erika case Erika writes master sucker space lizard Erika here I just listened to your anti-vaxxer episode and you didn't mention that crazy viral video about the girl who had a flu shot girl got a flu shot and it supposedly made her to where she could only walk backwards and made her speech completely destroyed I hope you see this message and addressed this because when I was younger that video terrified me about flu shots can't wait for the upcoming cult suck love all you do really hope you come back to Nashville soon keep on sucking prays Bojangles Thank You Erika you know I never mention that video because I did not know it existed but thanks to you now I do know and now I've seen it and seen some other videos that were taken after that video came out yes the video you speak of originally aired on Inside Edition one of the show's most popular segments and then online it did go viral and the video was a young woman named Desiree Jennings in 2019 excuse me 2009 the 26 year old Washington Redskins cheerleader claimed she had acquired a rare neurological disorder called dystonia from a flu shot so the symptoms came on immediately after she got the shot on the inside edition piece yes she spasms and and yeah she can't speak properly unless she's walking backwards or jogging but otherwise she's just twitching out excuse me can't speak well after the clip you saw went viral Inside Edition did secret surveillance on Desiree for four weeks and wouldn't you know it when she didn't know she was being filmed walking around totally fine totally fine no stumbly no spasms at all no slurred speech she is a hundred percent fine and then they ambushed her TMZ style and an initially she was fine and it started to slip into the thing she claimed originally Inside Edition interviews after they catch her they also interview dr. Steven novella the neural neurology professor and critical thinking expert that I've mentioned I mention him several times I'm talking about the great courses plus this guy is an expert in dystonia and he said on Inside Edition that her symptoms did not match that disease and then when yeah when Inside Edition confronted her about faking her disorder she spoke normal for a second and then slipped into a Australian ish accent even though she's from Ohio she said that the disease the flu shot gave her an accent now and dr. novella addressed that saying there's no way a flu shot can cause someone's accent to change and you can feel him holding back an eye roll when he says that fighting the urge to say yeah she's full of [ __ ] then Desiree tried claiming that some New Age healer cured her dystonia in 48 hours using completely debunked treatment techniques also an Inside Edition first-in friend Desiree again in the parking lot yeah yeah sorry already sorry I said - they jumped at my notes yeah speaking totally normal and then when she walks away she also walks you know with spasms and a limp so clearly she faked the whole thing why nobody knows for sure people are crazy maybe she's trying to get money maybe she just wanted the attention sorry that she made you afraid of getting a flu shot Desiree and sadly sometimes now people still point to that isn't that again with the kind of the lore of how things work you know it's like the ninth circle cult you know this one guy makes up something and then people later will just point to it as like evidence even though it's complete nonsense same thing with this people will be like yeah what about that girl I mean come on that girl right after her flu shot shall these spasms you know she can't speak right yeah she can you just didn't see the second part when it was debunked another vaccination update from Time sucker Mark Johnson mark writes holy [ __ ] balls I must throw my hat in with the suck masters of priam on vaccination debate I really don't think people understand how real a threat this is I'm gonna give you all a little info I and any other veteran you might know we're privy to going over yonder to Iraq I have what we used to call the old folks karma left shoulder I'm 37 it looks like someone stuck an old car lighter to the skin this is the smallpox vaccination if you check grandparents most will have it but there's a giant gap where the vaccine was no longer needed as a submaster inform so why were veterans of Iraq and the 2000s given this apparently the terrorists had found a way to weaponize the virus we were informed that if smallpox were to break out again on US soil it would take a third of our population before they could get it under control we no longer manufacture the virus in large quantity so it is crucial we continue to vaccinate for viruses that can still pose a threat he'll Nimrod praise Bojangles vaccinate your [ __ ] kids holy [ __ ] mark yeah thank you for that update I had no idea that that happened after your update at Google yes sure enough just like you said President George HW Bush made sure to inoculate u.s. soldiers headed into Iraq with a smallpox virus because of the threat you just laid out yes preventing soldiers from bringing a biological weapon back into an unvaccinated and defenseless civilian population another reason to vaccinate it would be you know a tragedy on a scope we have not seen in our lifetime or yeah it would just be unprecedented in the the scope of death that would occur Thanks that update thank for your service another vaccination update from Tony Lee Tony writes hey Dan hail Nimrod just wanted to see if I could pick your brain a bit more about the vaccination stuff while I wholeheartedly agree with everything you said in this most recent suck there is one phenomena that I would say is pretty inevitable and it makes me sick to think about you mentioned a few concepts like herd immunity or the idea that communism will always fail because of human corruption and I agree with those things as you've stated them however on the same tangent and I hate how close I'm feeling to get into being anecdotal what about things like the Tuskegee experiments when our own government in recent history performed a racist experiment using syphilis thinking of that as incident and others of that nature how can you blindly trust the mystery juice that they shoot you up with a Walmart I'm not arguing against vaccinations just that I'd like to be able to have more faith that I'm getting what I want from it for my child's sake at least in any case pet the best boy Bojangles for me rub one out for lucifina suck on my man great points Tony why should we trust the government when they have for sure lied to us in the past very fair my answer would be this the Tuskegee Experiment is the exception to the rule while the US government has for sure done things to abuse the trust of its own citizens and harm its own people as far as we know that those things are the exception to the norm and the vast majority of medical situation doctors have done whatever the current scientific knowledge base says is the best thing to do for our safety so while the government might be trying to hurt us the odds are much in more in favor of them trying to help us and all that medical science tells us that if we don't get vaccinated and the bad is rolls through that we are [ __ ] so for me it's about playing the odds is there a small chance something shady can be going on yes but I think it's a very very very small chance and I'll discuss this a little bit more depth than one of these next updates here but I think you know if you're just gonna play the odds much more likely that not back saying your kids will cause more harm then back saying them which is why it makes sense to me to get vaccinated hail número to Tony now for this a great argument in favor or some great you know points brought up in favor of not getting vaccinated or at least how we shouldn't be you know forced to be vaccinated sent in from Time sucker Jessie Bogart Jessie rights Dan I want to start with this all of my kids are vaccinated also sorry for the long email however this was a subject I struggled with a lot I did a ton of research on the subject and came to the same conclusion that you came to but most of your arguments suck first the freedom argument is a poor one the argument that because these freedoms are excuse me the argument that because these other freedoms are taken from us then you can't fight the other freedoms being reached for is the definition of a slippery slope second the idea that we should trust a doctor because of their training is historically wrong doctors use bleeding lychee leeches lobotomies masturbated angry women to cure hysteria doctors for years pushed oxycontin actually I don't why skip that yet a really funny parent said this one actually works in my experience regarding the hysteria doctors for years push oxycontin because they were convinced by the pharmaceutical companies that it was safe I think that the medical community and primarily the pharmaceutical companies have built an empire on buying legislation for example look up me to drugs a wafer farmer to bypass common patent laws and buying medical schools and doctors through donations and incentives can you say that you believe that if a major pharmaceutical company knew they could be making a swimming pool full of Scrooge McDuck gold coins but some kids might get autism they would pull the vaccine off the market this in my opinion is why the anti-vaccine has taken hold because they have proven themselves to be untrustworthy however after a pile of research I decided that the biggest risk of vaccinations far outweighed the biggest risk of not but I could see why someone might slide off the other side of that argument Justin for thought thanks for the great content love the podcast and your standup keep with the great work Jesse Jesse I love your mind man I wish I would have talked to you before I did that episode cuz you brought up some great counter points to what I laid out is giving away freedoms a slippery slope sure it is I'm not denying that but as I said in the suck I just think it's a slope that we're already on that was my point of the analogy like we've already given up freedom does that mean we should give up all of them no but it does mean that giving up some you know uh but doesn't mean they giving up some will lead us to having all of our rights taken away also know also I don't think no sorry I have to look my notes I want to carefully say this Reverend dr. Joe a horse [ __ ] Johnson told me the right before car seats became legally mandatory there was the same push back don't tell me what I can and can't do you know from freedom-loving citizens citizens who are worried that if they you know let the government tell them that they had to put their kids in a car seat what other freedoms would they lose but then study after studies show that you know car seats saved thousands of children's lives first responders got tired of shoveling toddlers corpses off the road after minor traffic accidents so lawmakers said your freedom right can take a backseat you know pun intended to safety on this one so put your kid in the car seat in the backseat or get a ticket and then thousands of kids now don't die every year because of that freedom being taken away and I'm using the same logic in favor of mandatory vaccinations and as for your second argument in is there a history of quackery in the medical field yes I've done a stand-up bit on exactly that concept right whiskey laudanum so but you know it's different now studies are done differently now studies are now done using the scientific method that wasn't available in the whiskey lot of Saudis doctors and researchers not in the big in the pockets a big pharma can do independent studies they have independently verified the safety of vaccines also doctors in other countries not part of our me to drug laws have also verified the effectiveness and safety of vaccines so while I see your point I also understand that because our info can be shared across the world different than it ever could be before it would be so much harder now for doctors to pull off you know pushing shitty vaccines on the public they would have to pull it off in numerous countries country's doctors would have to be blind to this happening or be paid off the scope of it I don't think is able to work but again love the points you make and that's why when it comes to vaccines than any other medical practice I think we need to have independent watchdog organizations make sure government and Big Pharma are doing what they're supposed to do and so while I say I'm Pro mandatory vaccines I'm Pro as long as it comes with strong independent governmental oversight so thank you again Jesse love you calling me out I did not do a good job of explaining how rational the concerns of anti-vaxxers are in many respects okay one last one and I'm sure I'll do more next week so many were sent in a hold to our episodes worth easy space lizard Adam reads for Minnesota has an interesting perspective on Aldous Adam writes hey master soccer OD spaces are Adam from Minnesota responding to this week's suck about vaccines I've been waiting on this stuff for a while since it's a subject near and dear to my heart I have a ten-year-old son with severe ASD autism spectrum disorder he's mostly nonverbal and needs constant care and supervision he does a lot of stimming which is short for self simulation it's a way for autistic people to deal with over stimulation from the world around them or calm jittery nerves stemming can take on a lot of different forms but his involves a lot of hand flapping humming and when he's really excited screaming it's pretty much non-stop all day and he can really get on her nerves but at the same time it helps him there's not a lot we can do to stop but anyway despite all of that he's really a happy loving kid with the great sense of humor he likes to play practical jokes and see if he can grow sad his mom which I enjoy very much the way I see it his ASD doesn't define him and underneath it is a great kid if you take the time to get to know him I want everyone to know that there's an intelligent curious and funny kid underneath the autism he's going into fourth grade and for the most part is on the same intellectual level as his peers just needs a different classroom structure to help him learn I give that background because it's made it I've made it a mission in my life to raise autism awareness we don't keep him shut in at home and tried to get him out to socialize and learn how to function in the world we get a lot of different reactions out in public ASD is an invisible disorder and by that I mean it's not outwardly and parent like other disorders like Down syndrome people see a seemingly normal-looking ten-year-old having a Mel like a toddler because he doesn't handle disappointment well I used to be bothered by people staring but now I let it ride if someone says something I use it as an opportunity to talk to them about autism what it is what it's not most people just try to ignore him the great ones engage him in his level and treat him like a normal kid then comes the ignorant [ __ ] was he vaccinated yes he was and guess what I was his mom was and I bet you were too I do my best to point out that science that supports the safety of vaccines and the debunking of the link between autism and vaccines but there are a lot of interweb experts out there too just don't want to listen to science the fact that people trust Jenny McCarthy for medical advice more than doctors baffles me the other one that really gets me is the yeah well autism didn't exist when I was a kid something changed as you pointed out in the suck yes it did you just didn't see them because they usually got locked away it makes me incredibly sad to know that if my son was born 50 years ago he probably would have had been diagnosed with childhood schizophrenia feeble-mindedness sent off somewhere to be institutionalized I had a really hard time listening to the Pennhurst suck as far as what really causes autism you did a great job of breaking it down our families participating in a genetic study of autistic kids and their immediate families being conducted by several universities to identify the genes that affect the brain and increase risks for autism we just got the results back last week in the case of our son he is caused by or it has caused his autism it caused by a very rare mutation of the t BR one gene that happened some time right around conception neither I nor my wife carry the same mutation nor does our neurotypical three-year-old daughter they're still not sure what would have caused this mutation or exactly what the implications are I asked if we can call my son an x-men and according to my wife I'm not funny this gene was only recently identified there are less than a hundred known cases worldwide I'm sure there are probably a lot more our hope from these genetic studies is that someday there might be treatments to help him or at least to help him or at least to help other people identify risk factors or begin treatment sooner in the short term it doesn't change anything about how we care for him and love him but it does give us peace of mind to know that it was nothing that we did nor does our daughter need to worry about increased genetic risk if she decides to have kids someday anyway this is turn into a long email I have to go pull a toilet I have to go pull a toilet to retrieve a toy I'll pull a toy out of a toilet there are somethings flushed it happens about every three months here sometimes I just have to keep reminding myself that I love that little Newt Heil Nimrod keep on sucking Adam thanks so much Adam what a great perspective you have on all this and the favorite point of mind that you bring up is that you know that you know that you know your son being on the autistic spectrum is not your fault you know that getting him back standing did not you know influence in any way him be on him being on the autistic spectrum at all and how cool of you for participating that study I mean hopefully with enough studies like that science can figure out what does lead to autism and we can put the vaccination debate to rest forever thank you all for taking the time to send in those messages Heil Nimrod that's all for today I was sure this was gonna be a short episode I swear they can't all be this long I do want to do some shorter what the hell is wrong with me if you do want episodes of a more reasonable length you should subscribe to scare to death those ones gonna clock in and around an hour subscribe check out the trailer for scared to death bad magic productions on YouTube if you like it please I only ask that you leave enough time in your life to keep on sucking [Music] [Applause] hey before we get out here I got to put together an art or author bio really quick I'm gonna throw some stuff up on Amazon let me just type it out here hey thank you for reading this hope you are liking things that people read I like to go and talk to people sometimes at the library books are pretty fun do you think trucks are better to drive than cars sometimes I wonder about my grandpa when he told me that fishing for bass is usually more fun than trout hey grilled cheese is better when it's more warm don't you agree I like it anyways I don't know about highlighters you know sometimes I think a succulent might be better than a deciduous type plant because of the watering it's hard to say I like things that are red more than purple I've noticed that's kind of weird anyway I'm hungry see you later ",2
zndjGnsd0Jc,"dangerous high-risk sex offenders those who will because of the way they're psychologically wired almost certainly offend again what do we want to do with them as a society put him on an island leave him there until we can come up with a better plan that's what Washington State's been doing since 1990 sex offenders deemed to be at a high risk to reenter prison terms have been completed are now not being let go the mean sent to what's called a special commitment Center on McNeil Island and the Puget Sound just off the coast of Tacoma the inmates are no longer referred to as prisoners that referred to as residents but these residents aren't allowed to leave the island until the committee that oversees the center deems them to no longer be at risk to molest rape sexually assault otherwise harm or kill another person and that almost never happens very few residents are ever released from the island are we okay with this is it okay to essentially hold someone in prison indefinitely and the special commitment Center is just a refurbished prison sometimes decades after they've completed their sentences under any circumstances we'll explore that today we're also gonna look into the possibility of a cure for pedophiles and other sex offenders is there one we're going to look at the damage they caused their victims those who live and look at how widespread the problem of sexual predators is in society today this is different kind of suck and I like it I kept having to rein myself in when it came to additional research it's a fascinating topic and an important topic how do we keep our children and citizens in general safe from sexual predators and can we do that without throwing away some of our constitutional rights we'll throwing away some of

laughs in fun to be had so many other time suckers and space lizards for you to meet at these shows pedophile island right now [Music] okay before we look into how the McNeil Treatment Center aka pedophile island is dealing with sex offenders and dig into other ways we could choose to deal with this problem it only makes sense that we look into how big of a problem sex offenders actually are like how many are out there how much damage are they causing how likely is it you know for a a cotton imprisoned sex offender to Rhea fend once they are released is it fair to treat convicted sex offenders differently than other criminals a lot of questions to look into today you've likely all heard stories about people convicted for sexual offenses who are then released only to quickly reoffended or kill others some of the dirtbags we've covered in our true crime time stocks had sex offenses on their records before going on to hurt or murder more people I mean think about you know Golden State killer you know Richard DeAngelo serial rapist before he came a serial killer but in case you haven't heard these stories or just to jog your memory or just to piss you off and fired up about today's topic here are some examples of some dirtbags getting released from prison after raping or molesting someone only to quickly then commit similar or even worse crimes okay you've likely all heard the name Pat Sajak and I'm guessing most you know he's been hosting one of the world's most popular game shows Wheel of Fortune along with Vanna White for over 35 years now but I bet he didn't know that when he was 16 years old 1962 he's convicted of having sex with a nine-year-old boy he's put away in a juvenile detention center for six months and then three years later 1965 when he was 19 he got caught up ducting to eight year olds and served 90 days in jail with an additional four years for probation and if you're shocked right now I [ __ ] get it I was when I found out I was livid CBS will be keeping this under wraps for years they didn't find out until 1996 and by then they had too much money invested to risk you know letting out his criminal record they kept it quiet of course he did estimates now range from third that up from 30 to 70% of television network executives are also Illuminati members are also part of child sex cults and are reptilian and of course all those [ __ ] nonsense I patted Pat Sajak please forgive me I was a joke I said it was a joke right afterwards just but it's fun craziness that never happened I've heard nothing but good things about Pat Sajak I doubt Pat Sajak has even ever gotten a speeding ticket seems very wholesome he's polish that's true that is true so God knows what he's capable of but that was nonsense but I hope that some of you for a second were like are you [ __ ] kidding me they put him a real fortune after that anyway the posting was an old inside joke if you're new listener so let's talk about some real creeps now some actual [ __ ] who committed horrible sex crimes only to go on Andrea fend after often serving shockingly short sentences and to them I don't know I don't know why that last thing just to pick him of all people just makes me laugh it's so fine oh it's so [ __ ] up 2013 Corbin scumbag Breitenbach real real piece of [ __ ] now went to prison for raping a 22 year old woman in Kansas he was released on parole four years later year and a half shorter that's five and a half year sentence then just six weeks after being released by the Kansas Department of Corrections less than two months after getting out of prison this dirtbag brutally rapes a seven-year-old girl authorities say Breitenbach snuck into her bedroom in an apartment complex in wichita kansas around 3:00 a.m. on June 11th 2017 a real-life boogeyman authorities say he strangled a little girl until she was unconscious took her to an outdoor balcony where he proceeded to rape her he was arrested days later was charged with capital attempted murder average aggravated criminal sodomy and aggravated burglary and unfortunately Bojangles one-eye three legged pitbull defender TimesA didn't turn him into a [ __ ] human chew toy starting with this evil dick unfortunately as he tried to sneak into her room her father didn't sneak up behind him with a baseball bat and turn his skull into a goddamn pinata sadly officers didn't see him sneak in and weren't able to put about five slugs into his dick and balls and then make sure he didn't die I hate this guy so much and those like him monsters who walk amongst his preying on the weak and the defenseless lowest of the low Bojangles actually just left a sub dungeon to go work on now hitting the heavy back at the local gym before he kills somebody he can't handle hearing any more of today's suck get it's infuriating good boy Bojangles good I know you want to buy them all but you can't too much for one dog Corbett allegedly didn't know this little girl he just knew about her because he dated someone who lived in the same apartment complex I saw this guy's mugshot and he doesn't look like the stereotype of a sex offender not what I expected him to look like no wispy mustache no comb-over no greasy pasty skin not shifty I why did I think he'd look creepy that's another problem with pedophiles and sex offenders rapists don't always look like rapists you know think about Ted Bundy you want to think you can see him but you can't I mean oftentimes way more often than not the victim knows the perpetrator it was a family member or friend of the family korban looks like he could be a personal trainer at a gym ladies maybe some fresh out of college schoolteacher or some restaurant manager you know clean-cut square jaw handsome face looks like a guy you can trust but none of that matters does it that's not how life works he's a good reminder of how you can't see these people coming you gotta be extra safe with your kids then everyone you think you know you can trust him with to be as sure as you can be then there's the case of Canadian dirtbag Peter Whitmore Whitmore has been repeatedly abducting and raping Canadian children since 1989 he keeps getting caught and he keeps getting released only to attack again and again and again in 1993 sex offenses against four young boys earned him only 16 months in jail four months per boy Peter quickly abducted molested an eight year old girl when he got out and that sending back to jail for four years and eight months and then in 2000 he was arrested in a hotel room with a 13 year old boy he was clearly not there just to watch movies with he wasn't there to show him how the remote works or bring him some room service and then split Peter was sent to prison for a year then in 2002 he was caught with an abducted five-year-old boy and a rape kit that included zip ties duct tape KY lubricant and child pornography he was then executed on side by officers immediately as per the right to do so under a no tolerance for disgusting child abductors program Canada had just launched yeah right I wish I'll be so great in reality was sent to jail for only three years three years three [ __ ] years for being caught with a kid he'd kidnap as a convicted pedophile already and having a child torture and rape kit on him three years after numerous other convictions for sexual assaults hits other children in 2006 after being released again he attacked again this time he kidnapped two young boys chain them up in an abandoned farmhouse for several days and raped both of them repeatedly incredibly after getting caught he was still not given life in prison he's been kind of tough you three different kids now caught raping torturing otherwise sexually assaulted a total of seven kids Ryan they just the ones that he's been caught for about to rape two others and then let's say less than a decade later he'd be up for parole yep this guy's been eligible for parole since 2015 in 2016 one of the boys publicly one of his victims publicly pleaded for him to never be released saying I deal with night terrors every night there's nothing you can really do I've just learned to let the emotions go just live through it I don't want to see this happen to another family to another child but it just keeps happening current sentencing laws in Canada they just can't keep a guy like Peter Whitmore in jail and definitely despite all the horrible things he's done I get a little angry me too if you're not if you're not fired up I'm a little worried about you there's the case of another Canadian sex offender Brian I hope you hear this suck and you I hope you shoot yourself in the [ __ ] face a bro Simo in 1992 Brian broke into the home of an ex-girlfriend and raped her he was out of prison 1996 shot somebody a few months later 2002 he was out and free raped the same ex-girlfriend again 2004 handcuffed a prostitute brutally beat and repeatedly raped her also in 2004 drove his van of course he drives a [ __ ] creepy van drove his van into two young girls in his neighborhood like like hit the girls with his van and does not call an ambulance luckily neither girl dies while the girls are laying on the ground battered from the car accident he grabs the youngest one only 11 years old puts her in the van tapes her eyes and mouth shut and rapes her while he leaves the other one on the road to possibly die he sentenced to 18 years in prison and the released just over a decade later in 2017 despite numerous pleas by numerous family members of the victims to please keep him incarcerated why why are these guys given second third fourth and fifth chances how is that justice when you've committed crimes of that nature time and time again why the [ __ ] would you ever be given another chance at redemption at what point as a society do we throw in the towel and say enough is enough [ __ ] this [ __ ] over 30 years ago James Dean Barnett the James Dean of child molesters was convicted in London Ontario for sexually assaulting a ten-year-old boy when he was 21 while he volunteered at the Boys & Girls Club he gets three months in jail another three months of probation then he gets a criminal pardon that wipes his record clean he changed his name to Tyler Geils and he starts molesting again he befriends some neighbors to the point they trust him to babysit their kids overnight while they go on vacation during this overnight babysitting situation he repeatedly molest his kids after he's arrested another victim from an assault ten years prior comes forward who knows how many other victims have stayed silent he is currently awaiting sentencing and the list goes on and on and on there is story after story after story a sex offender that's sex offender being released and then molesting or killing once they get out and if you're wondering why most of the pedophile examples are Canadians it is because Canada has the world's highest per capita amount of pedophiles one in 12 Canadians have either been accused or convicted of serious sex crimes and the ratio used to be worse during the early 60s cultural historians speculated one in four canadians perpetrating sex crimes both in Canada and abroad some people believe some researchers that at least half of all Canadian hockey players are also child molesters Victoria British Columbia was known as the rape capital of the world in the early 70s and Toronto is still referred to by some as diddle City and none of that is true that's true I hope it's not but I hope at least one person turned out to suck right for hearing me say Toronto is known as diddle City and I hope they bring that up to at least one other person did you attend the Hank and are going to Toronto for the weekend really Dental City are you bringing the kids I mean yeah we are we are bringing the wait did you did you just say density uh no more pedophiles in Canada per capita than in the US or any other nation as far as they know I just happened to find those examples on a list of reoffending Canadian sex offenders before I found any others for whatever reason there is there is more studies available on the web more articles about pedophiles from Canada than any other country like but by quite a bit I have no idea why that is when I look at news story after news story of sex offenders attacking this person or that child over and over so many stories I start to wonder how big is the problem with sex offenders like how many are out there in society I did find us stats for this finding the test wasn't easy but but here's what I came across the most recent survey I could find was conducted by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in 2012 and they reported that there were seven hundred and forty seven thousand four hundred and eight registered sex offenders living in the US this does not include incarcerated sex offenders I can't find any recent reliable information regarding how many are also in prison right now back in 1997 there were two hundred and thirty four thousand sex offenders either in prison or in some type of halfway house or you know law enforcement supervised release situation so it's so-so so back to the roughly 750,000 sex offenders living amongst us in the u.s. right now or recently 2012 the u.s. population in 2012 was 314 million so doing some math roughly one in four hundred and twenty people registered sex offenders how many sex offenders are caught though compared to how many people are actually committing sexual offenses what do criminologists have to say about that there's a lot of different numbers for this but according to the National sexual violence Resource Center 63 percent of sexual assaults are not reported to police the US Justice Department defines the term sexual assault by the way as any non-consensual sexual act prescribed by federal tribal or state law including when the victim lacks capacity to consent so doing some quick admittedly loose math a bit of speculation if around two-thirds of sex crimes are not reported maybe we could assume that around of sex offenders don't get caught or registered so that means that there could be three times as many sex offenders out there than that number of just 750,000 that I mentioned earlier from 2012 which would translate to around 2 million 250,000 offenders and if that was true that would mean that around one in a hundred and forty people could be sex offenders that number is pretty scary to me but that number still doesn't show anywhere close to the true scope of the problem because it's not like each sex offender just assaults one victim many of them assault numerous victims so how many people are being sexually assaulted these numbers are more important how many victims are out there well 3 million 500 1000 kids received CPS child protective service investigations in just 2017 8.6 percent were sexual abuse allegations that's three hundred and one thousand eight hundred three hundred one thousand eighty six sexual abuse investigation yes just over three hundred thousand sexual abuse investigation in one year has a lot of kids in just one country and one year being sexually victimized and I know that an investigation doesn't automatically equate to guilt but sexual offences particularly those games children is still also a chronically under underreported crime so the real number of kids being molested 2017 probably at least possibly much higher than three hundred one thousand eighty six according to the Department of Justice stats as recent as 2012 at least three hundred thousand women are raped in the US every year on average every year I mean what according to numerous sources one out of every six American women will be the victim of an attempted or completed rape in their lifetime one in 33 men will be the victim at some point in their lifetime and there's a ton of other stats on a long list of websites regarding to how widespread and pervasive the problem of sexual abuse is here's a few from a nonprofit organization called darkness to light committed to empowering adults and preventing sexual abuse of children about 1 in 10 children will be sexually abused before their 18th birthday nearly 70 percent of all reported sexual assaults including assaults on adults occur to children ages 17 and under 44 percent of rapes with penetration occurred to children under age 18 as younger than 12 accounted for 15% of those rapes another 29% of rape victims were between 12 and 17 most kids are not abused by creepy stranger about 90% of children who are the victims of sexual abuse know their abuser children living with either excuse me children living without either parent such as foster children ten times more likely to be sexually abused than children that live in both with both biological parents and then females are five times more likely to be abused in males I did find a bit of good news and darkness to light stats the number of identified incidents of child sexual abuse actually decreased at least forty seven percent from 1993 to 2006 but while the number of incidents seems to be declining and I found that corroborated on a number of other sources the problem of sexual abuse is still far far far from over millions of millions of people in just the US have been sexually abused at some point in their lifetime they've enlisted had nude pictures taken them when they were underage been raped and forced to commit other sexual acts had other sexual acts committed upon them when they were minors the problem of sexual abuse is huge we don't know exactly how big it is but we know it's very big and it's not like this is just a u.s. problem or a Canadian problem kids are be molested and women and men are being raped or sexually assaulted in other ways all around the world every day every week every month every year and the victims of sexual abuse suffer for far longer than just the duration of the attack shield here's some here's some more disturbing stats children who have been sexually abused are three point eight times more likely to develop drug addictions which substantially then also increases their chances of being incarcerated later in life female rape victims 13 times more likely than non crime victims to have attempted suicide at some point in their lifetime I'm guessing the suicide rate is also higher for male victims one of the one of the better studies I found just happened to focus on women only most of the studies about sexual offenses have focus are either on women or children think about how many additional lives are affected by those suicides how many parents siblings spouses children and friends are affected when a sex offender molest someone when a rapist rapes they often victimized you know far more people than the person they're actually directly sexually abusing women who've been raped are 26 times more likely to have a serious drug abuse problem than women who haven't been raped so that's you know in an in addition to the drug addiction stat earlier just to develop some type of drug abuse problem way more likely sexual assault victims see their risk for major depression symptoms triple and their anxiety risk double they suffer far higher rates of PTSD than on victims they face higher divorce rates lead higher risk lifestyles in a variety of ways suffer a variety of self-esteem issues and/or tons of other physical and mental issues and another troubling lasting effect of being sexually abused and childhood is an increased chance of perpetrating sexual abuse later in life this is the whole cycle of abuse theory there have been numerous studies done on this and it seems that being sexually abused during childhood does make you two to three times as likely is someone who is not abused to become a pedophile and this is a little bit complicated because it depends on who abused you how are you abused the exact age there's a bunch of other fatty it gets real complicated I don't want to deal too far into that because it just becomes this litany of static for static for static for stat and it gets a little kind of hard to it to process it's it's tricky to nail down numbers because they're just so many different ways of being sexually abused with so many different ages again might yeah different types of perpetrators getting treatment right away can also affect you know your odds of becoming a perpetrator later and a lot of other factors it's complicated but it does increase the chances that you'll become a perpetrator also important to note that the overwhelming number of victims of sexual abuse including child sex abuse do not go on to become sexual abusers themselves I don't I don't want anyone looking at someone suspiciously because you know you know that they were victimized you know what a terrible way for that person did that beery victimized and one study conducted among seven hundred forty seven males the risk of being a perpetrator was positively correlated with reported sexual abuse victim experiences the overall rate of having been a victim was thirty five percent for perpetrators and 11 percent for non perpetrators just over three times it's likely to become a molester yourself when you were molested but still again even in the study which was high compared to some others 65% of those victimized would not go on to do something similar themselves and the rate was not as high for women in a study conducted by the same researchers more likely to to go on a reef end if you were a dude for whatever reason a study of 96 females 43% have been victims but only one would go on to be a perpetrator and various other studies I found seemed to reflect similar results most of the studies of sexual assaulters I should note have been conducted on men again which does make sense since most but not all sexual assaulters are men one study found that 80% of boys and 96% of girls have been assaulted by males another study found that 95% of Polish men were sexual predators and that study also found that a hundred percent of Polish Canadian men who played hockey were sexual predators 100% and that's super [ __ ] up and of course not true but it does kind of lead into one of today's sponsors today's first project time stuff is brought to you again by what a spirit supplies and more spectral Emporium has me worried again I want to tell you that sales over what is Mothman monster madness but heard Robert so to speak a few weeks ago and made me some real bad about huh huh it has been a bit typical heavy hum the lad treated Charles Goodman a few weeks ago is that he's despicable and he wanted to give me a real knuckle sandwich when I let him out of his

Jill s Levinson an American social worker with the PhD in social welfare has been studying sex offenders for decades done numerous studies on them and she's found that the general public seems to believe that 75 percent of sex offenders will reoffending I and terrifying Jill strongly personally disagrees with the general public and thinks this number is way too high six crimes researchers are are Carl Hanson Kelly Morton Berchem of Public Safety Canada conducted a large-scale meta-analysis of recidivism rates among adult offenders and found a rate of 14 percent over a period allergen five to six years so 14 percent of these people reoffended within five six years recidivism rates did increase over time reaching twenty four percent within 15 years but even that figures clearly out of alignment with the public's believe in a seventy five percent recidivism rate the rate also varied a lot for the type of sexual predator the 15-year recidivism rate is 13% for incest perpetrators twenty four percent for rapists thirty SOT thirty five percent for child molesters of boy victims a comprehensive 2014 meta-analysis review of twenty one recidivism studies by team of leading scholars found that 32 percent of sex offenders assessed as high risk to reoffend did so within 15 years for offenders judged to be low risk the number was 5 percent and for high risk offenders who made it 16 years with no reoffending this particular study the riaf entry is zero dr. Levenson states that we have lots and lots of recidivism research over 25 years and all of the recidivism studies are remarkably consistent with the number of people Rhea Rhea stood for a new sex crime is somewhere between five and 15 percent but can numbers that low be trusted is that actually accurate dr. Levinson is a highly accredited expert I am NOT however a lot of other highly accredited experts disagree with her assessment because these stats when it comes to sex offenders and recidivism rates can be extremely misleading and full disclosure dr. Levinson I should point out has been convicted of child molestation four separate times most recently in 2015 and this - she gave her taken from an interview conducted while she remains in prison and I should stop with those type of lists in this episode it's an is terrible it's terrible be so ridiculous if I was giving stats about how there's not that many pedophiles out there and the source of the stats was a pedophile incarcerated gone no Pat Sajak and doctor we're gonna show this podcast down but a lot of other experts do disagree with dr. Levenson the Leadership Council on child abuse and interpersonal violence group of about 50 child abuse researchers and experts cite a 1990 study of adult women that found that only 12% of those who said they've been raped action actually reported it to authorities only 12% of women who felt comfortable admitting they'd been raped in an anonymous study had actually reported those rapes to law enforcement based on this low reporting number the council offers a hypothetical if a hundred percent of a sample of released sex offenders commits another sex crime but the rate of reporting is only 12 percent and only half of those reports of those reported are convicted then the official recidivism rate would be listed as only six percent when it is in fact far higher it would actually be 50 percent using their math half a pedophile is going on to reoffending problem for society overall than six percent not that six percent should be taken lightly I do understand the argument that even one victim one additional victim is unacceptable so what's the real number I would guess probably quite a bit higher than the five to 15% proposed by dr. Levinson possibly also quite a bit lower than the 75% the general public believes it but again even if the risk of reoffending only six percent roughly 117 is that a risk we're taking we're okay taking as a society you know what if what if you know some kid that falls in that six percent is your kid okay so now we still have yet to ask what to me is the most important question regarding today's suck and we are going to talk about the actual treatment center here soon but but first let's explore this is important competi files or serial rapists high-risk sex offenders people who are literally attracted to raping or to children can they be cured is it even possible can they ever be rehabilitated to the point that they are no longer attracted to children or to a criminal act like rape I think there is a much more important I think this gives me is a much more important question than you know will they reoffended they want to reoffended they reoffended given a good opportunity to do so thinking they could get away with it well the short answer is terrifying and the short answer is what I remember remember studying you know 20 years ago now and the science hasn't changed pedophilia cannot be cured additionally an actual attraction to the act of raping or an actual attraction to some other violent non-consensual act cannot be cured there's no cure for pedophilia this is a really important point to keep in mind as we think about how to deal with pedophiles as a society a 2010 article on pedophilia published by Harvard researchers actually opens with the sentence there is no cure so the focus is on protecting children this article continues with classified as a paraphilia and abnormal sexual behavior researchers have found no effective treatment like other sexual orientations pedophilia is unlikely to change the goal of treatment therefore is to prevent someone from acting on pedophile urges either by decreasing sexual arousal around children or increasing the ability to manage that arousal but neither is as effective for reducing harm as preventing access to children or providing close supervision I read into that that preventing access children putting them on an island here are some more I've seen data gathered by researchers these same researchers nearly all people with pedophilic tendencies are male studies of child molesters have reported that only 1 to 6% of perpetrators are female co-occurring disorder such as personality disorders or mood disorders are common in people with pedophilic tendencies and about 50% to 70% of people with pedophilic tendencies are also diagnosed with another paraphilia such as exhibitionism voyeurism or sadism the researchers also state several reports have concluded that most people with pedophilic tendencies eventually act on their sexual urges in some way typically this involves exposing themselves to children watching naked children masturbating in front of children or touching children's genitals oral anal or vaginal penetration is less common man think about that sentence most people with pedophilic tendencies eventually act on their sexual urges in some way that's scary most don't like to hear the word most in this context the Harvard researchers also further stress their point that this problem is a scary one is a tough one to solve stating fears about predatory behavior or valid most pedophiles who act on their impulses do so by manipulating children and gradually desensitizing them to inappropriate behavior and finally they say estimates of recidivism vary because studies define this term in different ways one review found receiveth recidivism rates of ten to fifty percent among pedophiles previously convicted of sexual abuse although this could include anything from an arrest for an offense to reconviction of a crime against a child one long-term study of previously convicted paedophiles with an average follow-up of 25 years found that one-fourth of heterosexual pedophiles and one half of homosexual or bisexual pedophiles went on to commit another sexual offense against children those numbers a lot higher than 6% and here's what James Kanter PhD an international expert on pedophilia associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Toronto not not called diddle City ever and the editor in chief of sexual abuse a journal of research and treatment had to say about treating pedophiles in a 2013 interview he said therapists have been attempting to turn pedophiles into non pedophiles for a very long time but no one has presented any objective evidence of any enduring change in sexual interests pedophilia can be meaningfully meaningfully described as sexual orientation scientists have more specifically called it an age orientation how creepy is that some people are attracted to an age to be 14 to be 10 to be 5 could be younger dr. Kanter continues the best treatments we have available for pedophiles help them develop the skills they need to live a healthy offense free life and in some cases to block their sex tries if they feel this would help them we have not yet found a way to convert pedophiles into non pedophiles that are any more effective than the many failed attempts to convert gay men and lesbians into heterosexuals so obviously you know not being able to change their mode of thinking very concerning there is no cure for pedophilia any more than you can cure heterosexuality or homosexuality or bisexuality or any other sexual preference at the end of the day researchers still aren't sure exactly why we all are attracted to what we are tract 2 on various studies pedophile show signs that their sexual interests are related to brain structure and that at least some differences exist in their brains between them and non pedophiles and those in those differences may exist before birth now an important thing to note here when talking about pedophiles and when talking about other sex offenders with an actual sexual attraction towards something like sadism is that not all sex offenders share this attraction share these attractions a sex offender who is convicted of rape after getting really drunk ignoring someone's demands to stop is sometimes a very different offender than someone who is actually attracted to the act of raping not everyone who rapes wants to rape more and more and more not everyone who molest one child wants to molest as many as they can get their hands on and again you can argue that one time is too many times and I hear you I I just want to clarify that when it comes to the issue of is a convicted sex offender bound to reoffended them out of prison some depending on their kind of attractions much much much much more likely to reoffending others a lot of the research I came across stated that molesting a child doesn't necessarily mean that someone's a pedophile that they're hardwired to have sex with kids yeah sometimes it's a random crime of opportunity not part of a pattern I remember learning years ago about how sexuality exists on a spectrum the Kinsey scale you've probably heard of it famous sexologist dr. Alfred Kinsey and some other researchers he worked with developed a theory of sexuality the sexuality is fluid it first was published back in 1948 and the Kinsey team interviewed thousands of people about their sexual histories research showed that sexual behavior thoughts feelings towards the same or opposite sex we're not always consistent across time instead of a set assigning people to three categories heterosexual bisexual homosexual the team used a seven point scale and there's actually another kind of category through in there it ranges from zero to six with additional category with an additional category of X so zero exclusively heterosexual one predominantly heterosexual only incidentally homosexual some bestiality and tendencies to predominantly heterosexual but more than incidentally homosexual pretty into bestiality three equally heterosexual and homosexual and into animals four predominantly homosexual but more than Stanly heterosexual and interested in groups and group sex situations with animals five predominantly homosexual only incidentally heterosexual and attracted to horses or other large animals six exclusively homosexual and hopefully know all the L references in the scale were made up nonsense by me but the rest is legit and then X no socio sexual contacts or reactions kinda like a set like a sexual so where are you on the scale and think about the scale will lead to some thoughts on on pedophilia this is where I'm bringing this up I'm a zero which doesn't make me homophobic I've actually been so not homophobic for a number of years I've often been a thought to be homosexual by certain probably someone home with other people because they mentioned you know how too long or kiss each other on the cheeks or sit too close to each other I can hug dude friends I'm a hugger I cube dude dude friends a little peck even on the lips the right situation oh you did it you beautiful bastard you're engaged what whatever I don't get aroused in these moments if I did I'd be at least incidentally homosexual dicks just don't do it for me other than the one that I have and I wouldn't even want to put that one in my mouth if I was that flexible the the good feel they don't have a mouth on my dick would be canceled out by the uncomfortable feeling of knowing that the dick was in my mouth but I have when I'm going through puberty I have had sex with items outside the homosexual or heterosexual spectrum as we're paraphilia kind of comes in you know pedophilia falls on a paraphilia like like some pillows banana peel one time in a grocery store bathroom grocery store I worked at not going to go into great detail at that incident but there were several incidents of I wonder what that would feel like if I put my dick on it or put my dick in it and then I found out and I doubt any longtime listeners are surprised but I wasn't really outside the scale I guess because I still fantasized about some woman you know you know my dick may have been in a cushion but I was thinking about Anna Nicole Smith when she just become a Playboy centerfold or a few other centerfolds or some girls I went to school with or my mom's friend Paulette I thought I thought about true story it's not about them while I [ __ ] a pillow or whatever the attraction wasn't to the pillow the pillow was just a mass Batory accessory that's not the case for everyone you know space lizard patron was her reason her two secrets suck about a guy who sexually attracted to cars he likes to [ __ ] his sex relationship with his car he's on a whole other scale outside of the Kinsey scale that's objective philia sexual and sometimes also romantic attractions to an intimate inanimate object objective philia is another type of paraphilia other paraphilias are necrophilia sexual attraction towards corpses piquerism sexual arousal by piercing the flesh of another person most commonly through cutting or stabbing with a sharp object think of Russian serial killer under gvt low rap to philia sexual attraction towards raping someone copper philia attraction towards feces literally turned on by [ __ ] or the act of someone [ __ ] and of course pedophilia sexual attraction towards prepubescent children and there is no cure for paraphilias what's that quote the heart wants what the heart wants well unfortunately for some so so did the genitals more specifically even though some women pedophiles do exist usually it's the ween wants with the wing once and some people have super [ __ ] up evil Wiens they want to stick themselves in terrible places like a variety of holes that they don't want them to be there and we talked about various other pair of feelers before they make Jeffrey Dahmer you know he was attracted to specific body parts like the bicep sexually aroused when cutting someone's bicep off again jiggety low you know essentially attracted the blood shed specifically to stabbing and cutting someone stabbing it you know it would sometimes caused him to spontaneously ejaculate so there's actually a much wider spectrum of sexuality than what you would think of on that Kinsey scale and what what seems to have you know been proven time and time again with studies is that your sexual orientation isn't necessarily like based on who you're having or what you're having sex with in the moment it's based on what you fantasize about that makes sense so like a pedophile might be able to have sex with with an adult sometimes they can be attracted to both the the spectrum sexuality is very fluid that way sometimes where people can have numerous attractions thing about like bisexuals and so sometimes some people are more sexually attracted to children than others and what's terrifying about it is even if they're not having sex with a kid that's what they have to think about to turn themselves on like for me if I wanted to ejaculate I had to [ __ ] when I was [ __ ] a pillow I had to think about a woman I couldn't think about man's [ __ ] sexy ass pillow man I still have [ __ ] pillows you know because my orientation is heterosexual and and that will never change study after study has shown that whatever your sexual orientation is that way whatever your sexual preference is scuse me sexual preference it's gonna stay that way you know if you like dudes you're always gonna like dudes if you like women you're always gonna like women if you like both you're always gonna like both on some level and unfortunately if you want to [ __ ] kids you're always gonna want to [ __ ] kids and this I know some people don't necessarily believe in the spectrum sexuality it makes a lot of sense to me I just think about how complex we meet sacks are in general if they can think about our purposes for music what one person passed she believes through the best band ever another person despises some meat sacks don't care about music in general crazy I know but if I've met him you know meat sack tastes and preferences vary widely think about how different we all are physically how many different conditions and syndromes and disorders there are were so you know someone can have a much harder skin than someone else or have a totally different arms a torso torso ratio or or not have arms or legs but be otherwise fine or have arms and legs and have those be fine but have some digestive problems or have facial deformities or speech impediments like me like a mush mouth so many obvious physical differences we have well the mind is very different as well we think in so many different ways math comes easy for some but not for others some people have better vocabulary skills some people have better memories you know some people are just much smarter overall than other people just like some people run faster than the rest of us some people think faster think better so why would sexuality be any less diverse any less complex right there are just so many different attractions and fetishes and interests and sexual inclinations and to pretend otherwise I think is a little bit silly so we now know that there are people who are attracted to children in a way that cannot be cured that is their that's the how they're wired sexually there there are others who are wired in a way that they're attracted to sexually harming others the act of harm you know some of the form of sadism and that can't be changed so what do we do with these people what do we do with this specific type of sex offender the career criminal of sexual offenders so to speak well you know III can't think right now I'm sorry uh what we should do with sex offenders is probably probably different than what we do with other criminals you know I can't think right now about how we should punish someone for shoplifting anymore that I can think about how to punish someone for for date rape or or a sexual crime of opportunity today I'm just looking at the the very specific crime of sexual offenders who are very likely to reoffending kenabeek I do think there are a very specific type of criminal and and legislators have felt the same way and and that all brings us to pedophile island so now we're here hopefully everything has made sense I know it's a lot of information I wrote and rewrote and rewrote and rewrote this over and over again to try to get it the most clear okay so off the coast of Washington state are many picturesque islands populate with wealthy vacation owners but McNeil Island that's a different one it's currently inhabited by around 240 sexually violent predators whose prison sentences have ended but the state still refuses to release them these residents are in the view of the state the rapists and child molesters who are more most likely to commit new offenses and sex offenders finish serving prison times you know after they finish serving prison times for the crimes they committed and end of sentence review committee assesses whether or not they believe this person will be continual offender and and if they are deemed to be a you know high-risk then deemed to meet the definition of a sexually violent predator then they're sent off to this McNeil Island treatment center established in 1990 for an indefinite period of time to receive treatment once sent there it's proven nearly impossible to convince a court so far to re-release them the island referred to some as pedophile island only accessible by a ferry that runs every two hours since deep in the Puget Sound less than a mile from other islands you know not home two to nothing but sex offenders about two miles west of Tacoma it's less than seven square miles in size has a long history of incarceration normally at this point I jump into a times like a timeline but that's just it's just not gonna take long for this part today opened in 1875 the McNeil you know treatment center previously served as a territorial Correctional Facility so that's what it opened as first in 1875 it's a territorial Correctional facility and then it changed to a federal penitentiary American sentence in terms of imprisonment by the US courts that operated in China in the late 19th and early 20th century would serve their terms in McNeil Island in the 1910s inmates included Robert Stroud the Birdman of Alcatraz who fatally stabbed a prison guard on the island March 1916 during World War two eighty-five japanese-americans who resisted the draft of protest or wartime confinement were sentenced to prison terms McNeil all were later pardoned by President Truman in 1947 for a short time in 1960s the island was actually the home to infamous cult leader and early suc subject Charles Manson the state of Washington began to lease the facility from the federal government in 1981 later that year the State Department of Corrections began moving prisoners into the facility renamed it McNeil Island Corrections Center and the island was deeded to the state government in 1984 the special commitment Center for these high-risk sex offenders was established on the island in April 1990 to manage those committed under it are committed to it under a new act an act called the community Protection Act of 1990 more on that controversial legislation here in a bit in the beginning that commitment Center managed only six people that number grew at a rate of about 22 residents a year in late 2001 a temporary secure community transition facility was established in order to comply with legislation that allowed court-ordered conditional releases in 2003 the SC TF that security community transition facility was moved to its president to its present permanent location in the north complex on McNeil Island in May 2004 in the same complex the SCC special commitment center opened a dedicated facility known as the total confinement facility to house confined residents on April 1st 2011 the McNeil Island Corrections complex was closed because of state budget cuts but the special commitment Center remained open so you know for a long time for many many years it was a prison and then for a little while it was a prison and it also had this special commitment Center then the prison went away and now the only thing on the island is this special commitment Center so why do Washington State open this special commitment Center in 1990 why did they suddenly start putting pedal the island I mean there were obviously pedophiles high-risk pedophiles long before 1990 why not do it sooner well it has to do with some public outrage public outrage over a string of terrible sex crimes committed in the late 80s by three sex offenders who've already been caught previously for similar crimes and this pushed legislators to push through new sex offender specific legislation these crimes were committed by previously convicted sex offenders the state knew were dangerous newer and a high risk to reoffended couldn't legally keep them in prison the first of these three of course was Pat Sajak no it was not why do I want to keep saying that it was Earl Shriner in May 1987 Earl ke stranor a mentally disabled man with a long criminal record completed a ten year sentence in Washington for kidnapping and assaulting two teenage girls she had a 24 year criminal history of killing sexual assault and kidnapping prior to his discharge prison officials learned that he intended to torture children after he was released and they tried vigorously to detain him through existing civil commitment laws that covered mental illness however they were unable to legally prove he was dangerous under those existing laws and the state had no choice but to release Shriner a man they knew they were gonna hear from again two years after his release Shriner raped and strangled a seven-year-old boy in Tacoma Washington cut his penis off and left him in the woods to die and he did die [ __ ] they knew he would do something like this but they couldn't stop and they knew he was sick that he suffered from a compulsion to sexually and violently assault children but they had to let him go the Shriner case came to public attention one year after a young Seattle businesswoman was kidnapped and murdered by it by a different inmate an m8 on on work release program gene Raymond Caine gene had been placed on work release after serving his 13-year sentence for attacking two women Kane had been turned down I mean this is unbelievable to me Kane had just been turned down before this relates to this this work program turned down by the state's existing sexual psychopath Day program because the mental hospital can him too dangerous for them to handle how crazy is it too dangerous for a sexual psychopath program but not too dangerous for work release they knew he was [ __ ] dangerous but again they just didn't have the legal means to continue to confine him shortly after being released on September 26 1988 Jean abducted raped and murdered a 29 year old woman response to these crimes and significant public outcry from these first two offenders that governor then governor of Washington booth Gardner appointed citizens professionals and legislators in May 1989 - a taskforce on community protection asked them to recommend changes to state law and then during the taskforce deliberations Washington State had a new child murderer make headlines arguably the worst of these three one Wesley Allen dot Wow this [ __ ] oh man off the charts one afternoon in late 1989 28 year-old West they walked into the bathroom of a movie theater in Camas Washington little suburb that borders Vancouver just across the Columbia River from Portland Oregon in the theater dönitz spotted a five-year-old boy and waited for him to use the bathroom a few moments later Dodd grabbed him started moving towards the door as Dodd is walking out of the theater with the boy in his arms the child starts crying theater employees immediately become suspicious the boy starts fighting to get out of his grasp when the boy begins screaming for help they knew they were witnessing an abduction and they ran after Don realizing he wasn't gonna get away with taking this kid Don let the kid go runs to his car meanwhile employees tell the child's mother and her boyfriend William graves that her son had almost been abducted graves immediately asked for a description of Don's car and and runs after it on foot [ __ ] yeah man protect this kid he finds Don's car just a few blocks to the theater it broke down pretending to offer Wesley Health Gregg's approaches Don then puts him in a headlock and hopefully snuck in a few [ __ ] punches graves then physically hauls Don back to the theater like a [ __ ] champion where other witnesses bound Don's arms with the belt as they wait for the police to I hope this guy was given a cave the [ __ ] city hopefully more punches were snuck in maybe it knee to the head maybe a stomp to the nuts right justkeep yelled at the person to stay put just tell it just keep yelling at them to try to stop trying to escape as you continually stomp on their nuts once in police custody dad starts to confess to much more than this attempted abduction the incident the movie theater wasn't the first there had been many others and not all the victims had been lucky as lucky as this boy and been able to escape after three days of question dodd ends up - confessing to having murdered her ends up confessing to having murdered three children armed with a search warrant police searched Dawn's room in the town of Vancouver Washington inside they find photographs of one of the murdered children and the boys underwear nearby is a homemade torture rack and a diary containing a meticulous record of his murder and after and dodge arrest criminal history and subsequent insights into them into the mind of this violent pedophile lead legislators to to push through legislation that would lead to pedophile island Wesley Allen Dodd grew up in Washington in a somewhat troubled home he was a shy kid who had a dark sexual compulsion to expose himself to other Souls this guy's like the poster child for high-risk offenders he began acting on his compulsion to expose himself to other children when he was just 13 exposing himself was enough Witt and Don began to molest his younger cousins and neighborhood kids at 15 he was arrested from one of these incidents but due to his youth the police declined to pursue charges and recommended he get counseling Dodd continued molesting kids for the next several years in 1981 he joined the Navy he was discharged after his superiors discovered he was molesting kids on base this time he serves 19 days in jail 19 days and is ordered to undergo counseling the county has no effect on Don's compulsion to harm children he falls into a routine of molesting more kids getting caught over and over and over again being released with a slap on the wrist Don's sexual desires grew darker over the years he wrote in his diary about a desire not to just molest children but to murder them darker still he began writing about the possibility of performing medical experiments on his child victims to turn them into kid zombies he could victimize over and over and will he's like [ __ ] the pedophile version of Jeffrey Dahmer some dude wanted to turn kids into sex dummies September 1989 he lures Cole and William near 11 and 10 respectively into a wooded area forces them to undress ties them to a tree molest them tortures them stabs them repeatedly and leaves them to die a month later he lures a four-year-old boy into his apartment keeps him overnight molested him while taking photographs wants to wait to kill him so that the body will be fresh enough to perform his [ __ ] up zombie experiments in the morning Dodd strangles him hangs his body in the closet before leaving for work when he returned takes the body down dispose of it the trash bags and some trash bags only keeping the boys underwear with luminize body is discovered a manhunt is launched Wesley Alan Dodd meanwhile stays in his apartment making plans for future murders and constructing that torture rack the torture rack where he was gonna torture his next victim which which would have been that kid from the movie theater if people hadn't intervened and while this next part has nothing to do really with today's story I found it too interesting not to share about Dodd less than four years after confessing to these murders Dodd was executed I guess this will have something to do with today's story I'll tie this in later he refuses to appeal his case and he asked for capital punishment he insists that he is uncontrollable and that he will kill again stating in one court brief I must be executed before I have an opportunity to escape or kill someone else if I do escape I promise you I will kill and rape again and I will enjoy every minute of it that's what he says in court he also says in some interviews that deaths would give him relief from guilt he has over the murders during his trial he actually writes a pamphlet for parents on how parents can protect children from child molesters such as himself he also chooses to be hanged because that's how his final victim died his hanging was a the first use of that method for an execution in the US and almost 30 years so clearly this guy felt a strong uncontrollable compulsion to sexually abuse hurt and killed kids for his own sexual pleasure he knew he was very very sick he would have volunteered I'm sure to be put on his island the public outcry that follows these crimes eventually leads to then-governor booth Gardner to sign the community Protection Act of 1990 and we're gonna talk about this act right after a word from today's final sponsor time's up he's brought to you today by Lisa seriously they didn't know either by the way love Lisa they didn't know what today's topic was gonna be either for [ __ ] sake today's

I did not put that together until right before the show and it is darkly hilarious to me okay excuse me back to Washington's Community Protection Act of 1990 the the controversial Act was a package of laws aimed at sex offenders including tougher sentences a sex offender registration and the creation of a procedure that allowed authorities to indefinitely lock up sex offenders when a court believes them to be continued threat to the community the task force focuses attention on remedying the powerless the powerlessness that state officials face in 1987 when Shriner was released every proposal for reform was tested against his key question would it offer the state the necessary power to contain someone like Shriner who had reached the end of their maximum criminal sentence and yet clearly posed extreme risk to the public the task force solution enacted by the legislature addressed a small group of sex offenders called sexually violent predators individuals in this category were defined as those who have been convicted of or charged with a crime of sexual violence and suffer from a mental abnormality or personality disorder which makes the person likely to engage in predatory acts of sexual violence you know which includes pedophilia the law authorizes prosecutors or the Attorney General to initiate civil proceedings for a person who sentenced for a sexual violent offenses expired was about to expire and that person 1 has been convicted of a sexually violent crime is nearing the end of the criminal sentence of their criminal sense 2 is committed to sexually violent offenses a juvenile and is about to be released 3 has been charged with violent sexual offense but has been determined to be on incompetent to stand trial or 4 has been found not guilty of a sex offense by reason of insanity so if they fulfill any of those criteria they can be sent to this you know civil commitment center since the passage of this act 19 other states have enacted similar civil commitment laws there are now more than 5200 people civilly committed in the US according to a 2007 teen survey of 20 civil commitment centers about half the states with such laws allow the commitment of individuals who offended as juveniles many of these committed are diagnosed was some sort of paraphilia and out of all these centers Washington's civil commitment Center pedophile ins you it's the only one on an island dedicated to house the only sex offenders and also the first of its kind and all of these centers have been and continue to be controversial you know I mean basically just centering around is it okay to continue to hold someone and what essentially is a prison after the prison sentence has been completed for any circumstance you know I mean I mean what if we had some test to see if someone's gonna probably murder again in a non-sexual way or probably gonna rob a bank or probably gonna deal drugs would it be acceptable to have similar detainment centers for any other area of criminality is allowing these civil commitment centers to do what they do create a slippery slope to detain other people past their sentences are we getting into weird you know 1984 Orwellian territory here there have been a number of constitutional challenges to this set at these centers typically involving due process ex post facto Double Jeopardy Clause --is legal questions have been raised regarding the civil commitment of sexually violent predators or those of similar designations and the u.s. the US Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of these centers every time so far it's been three major cases so far and every time they're like nope this days the Florida civil commitment Center currently holds up to 720 residents billed is the worst sexual predators in that state but the committee who decides whether or not to continue to detain these inmates has a slight conflict of interest in its hands it's a private treatment center the commitment center is ran by four correct care recovery solutions a spin-off company of the GE ou Group one of the nation's largest private prison contractors and it's the source of over 270 million dollars in revenue so that that I don't love that I don't love the privatization of this I mean again if any group of inmates other than high-risk pedophiles were being detained would we be okay with the private company holding these prisoners indefinitely for profit I mean doesn't that slightly [ __ ] with a citizen's constitutional rights isn't that scary territory to to walk into while 20 states have laws that allow for the involuntary and indefinite civil commitment of sexually violent predators only Florida has turned the operation so far into a private for-profit or turned it turn to turn the operation of his command center over into the a for-profit private contractor moreover Florida involuntarily commits more people than any other state California ranks second a new law that increases the pool of offenders Florida can consider for civil commitment will likely increase the number of residents even further other measures are also being taken to put sex offenders behind bars for longer periods of time in Florida a law sign recently by former Florida Governor Rick Scott he just became a Senator in January extended civil commitment eligibility to offenders serving jail sentences yeah again that that makes that makes me nervous that makes me nervous you know what if more civil commitment centers become for-profit schemes you know businesses that indefinitely can confine or you know incarcerate individuals under the guise of treatment or under the believes that they may commit future crimes center of Minnesota was recently decided of a lawsuit because in the in the over two decades of its existence it has never released an inmate the Association of the for the treatment of sexual abusers does not take a position either in favor of or opposed to the use of these centers however a TSA believes that jurisdictions choosing to implement such legislation should be careful be careful in a manner consistent with relevant research and the best practices in assessing treating and managing sexual offenders they have some summary some are some recommendations for who should be detained and how should it be how should these detainment be handled it says for a small group of chronic violent or predatory offenders confinement and treatment may be appropriate and necessary to safeguard the community sexual predator assessments should be conducted using empirically validated risk assessment instruments measures and methods the state should provide a contemporary properly designed prison based treatment program to enable incarcerated offenders to receive treatment in order to promote risk reduction and successful community reintegration the state chooses to implement civil commitment it should be reserved for sexual offenders who are found to post the highest threat to public safety treatment that follows the end of incarceration / criminal jurisdiction in cases where a state elects to implement civil commitment should also be consistent with current research and professional standards and guidelines prior to being considered for a civil commitment should be offered opportunities during their regular criminal sentences to address their risk relevant mental disorders and needs through properly designed and competently implemented treatments so give them a chance to rehabilitate before they cannot be reviewed so so basically that's how these centers are set up so what is life like in these places how is pedophile island actually kind of ran MacNeil Islands unpopulated again except for those 214 people ish who live in the special 214 240 found a feeder for numbers between 200 to 150 people probably currently right now live in this special community center the people sent to the McNeil Island are called residents as we said not inmates and many of those committed or diagnosed with some form of paraphilia mental health professional mental health professionals are split as to whether that diagnosis for commitment is appropriate though dr. Shan dr. Shawn I guess Shona Shawn jumper president of the sexual offender civil commitment programs network told an interviewer in October of 2018 many of the sexual violent predator evaluations for men convicted of rape are diagnosed with paraphilia not otherwise specified the controversy lies he said in the fact that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders does not have a specific classifications for adults who are sexually aroused by those who don't consent so they have a hard time determining if someone you know and save hard time determine any like a psychological way if someone truly is attracted to the act of like raping or not or truly talking to kids about fundamentally these laws are about predicting a person's future risk which presents its own kind of you know philosophical and moral dilemmas to assess risk the states use actuarial scales which predict an offender's risk kind of same way a car insurance company determines insurance rates you know they they have this tests and that produces a score based on a number of mostly unchangeable things including criminal and relationship history so basically once you fail it it's very hard to pass it later based on your past actions you can't change current research and actual and actuary tools are designed to predict are not designed excuse me to individual risk says dr. Michael miner a professor of human sexuality at the University of Minnesota he says to some extent the criminal justice system is requiring opinions to be made requiring decisions to be made that goes somewhat beyond the knowledge base that we have so this is a tricky ethical dilemma this you know they're just there isn't enough information to really truly figure out if it's impossible to cure these these people and to truly determine if you know there there is some better way to deal with this problem minor says that aside from the problems with risk assessment he questions the entire civil commitment process he says you either have a mental defect that makes it unlikely that you can control your behavior and therefore you're not guilty by reason of insanity or you're responsible for your behavior it seems to me that a more honest system what did the front end say we think you're a bad guy and we're not going to let you out we're going to give you a life sentence I'm not advocating for life sentences for sex offenders but that seems like a more honest approach I like that thought I mean at the very least for pete's sexual offender should be maybe given life you know if you mess up once maybe you were falsely accused or something but twice highly doubt you were then unlucky and maybe some you know certain sexual offense crimes should just be one and done crimes in therapy on pedophile island offenders are encouraged to disclose all of their sexual deviance to help them understand the scope with a problem clinicians then target the factors that make them vulnerable to Rhea fend it then then these things can be can be brought up later like sorry sorry I'm skipping ahead here skipping ahead I was thinking about sorry bouncer my notes I'll get that a second they're supposed to they're encouraged to bring up all of their you know problems in the past and reasons where they may reoffending the the goal is to mitigate risk by modifying the thoughts and emotions you know regarding these problem issues dr. Elena Lopez chief of resident treatment at the SCC says we focus on what we can change is different every person they might have their own internal personal handles to keep them from progressing personality traits motivation acute medical condition stressors etc all civil commitment centers offer treatment but participation isn't mandatory on McNeil Island about 62 percent of the residents per dissipate in treatment which is weird to me so what's a 38% are just resigned to just stay in there forever once someone is labeled a sexually violent predator and committed to a civil commitment center yeah very difficult for them to get released they have the right to an annual review in which the court goes over their history and treatment progress and considers release they were yearly evaluation by a forensic team which reviews documents interviews offenders questions and collects results from a polygraph and penile Plus this oh man plus plus plus this MOG Rafi so this MOG Rafi a tool designed to measure sexual violence you know uh I thought I had a handle on when I didn't I read it but there's this tool basically a little band around your wing and it's like it's like a blood pump or blood pressure pump you know reader free wing right it just finds out how hard we hit it what a weird job somebody has somebody's job right now is to show a perv pictures of kids and find out how hard that makes their day we're foot I was thinking about the weird job I was thing up the people who have to carry out these kind of things all right there's somebody in a lab coat just be like what about what about this kid what about what if this kid was wearing a jumper well if they're a holding ice cream cone what if what if you were holding an ice cream cone that you were gonna give to them what if they were jumping rope while you held the ice cream cone and then ding ding ding like alarm goes off Oh back nope back in your cell charlie you're not getting off the island until jump rope start giving you a stop giving you half chubs it's [ __ ] crazy at somebody's job dr. Holly Coryell chief of Forensic Services at the SEC said forensic evaluators are ultimately looking to answer 3 psycho legal questions when determining if a resident is ready to leave does the person continue to meet the like legal criteria for a sexually violent predator are less restrictive alternatives in the person's best interest can conditions be imposed that would addict leave adequately protect the community they're being released into forensic evaluators answer these questions in a recommendation that is then forwarded to the court creating the opportunity for release hearings but arguing that a sex offender should be released the community very uphill battle the stake is to say at the beginning of trial he is a sexually violent predator canary said giving the jury to be on board with the idea that he not be violent anymore is very difficult and then make it even harder to earn release although offenders were encouraged to close everything in treatment that's what I was thinking of earlier sorry popped in my head I was it wasn't quite to the place where I should bring it up but remember they're encouraged to disclose every detail of their impulses in treatment but then everything they say in treatment gets to be used as evidence in this trial to decide if they're going to be released or not and so when you know people hear about all the things that they're fantasizing about probably not gonna let them out canary says when the jury hears this stuff you have your clients saying well sure I'm at risk too Rhea fend of hard to you know have somebody put that in perspective and get to get the jurors on your side so through the Washington Court process a civilly committed person can be released to last restrictive alternatives which typically include outpatient treatment tight restrictions or they can be released without conditions the number of people released nationally from these facilities extremely low on average they each house about 260 people of the 16 states that provided release numbers to a 2017 survey of civil commitment centers the average number of people released from a priscila facility per year with seven five states released an average of less than one person per year the low number of people released from these facilities makes it hard to research the effectiveness of these laws and these facilities because you don't know if the people their housing would actually reoffending let out so ours are these treatment centers that the right course of action when dealing with pedophiles I have some thoughts that you may be able to guess them that I'm gonna share here soon before I share them let's check in with today's idiots of the Internet [Music] okay so for today's video I found an April 2018 TEDx talk titled let's be mature about pedophilia and the speech the speaker was that batch speaker with Pat Sajak no what's that what that's funny to be so stupid Oh God okay now the speaker was Madeline van der van de Bruin who works in psychologist and criminologist and combines both in her work for the Dutch national police so Madeleine talks about I just can't sorry I gotta get this out of my head I just can't stop thinking what fortune okay we all have our crosses to bear uh so [ __ ] why why okay honey I don't understand why my brain thinks the way doesn't it Madeline talks about how 0.5 up to 3% of the male population is some pedophilic interests I didn't I did not research that particular number that's it that's what she says she hasn't kind of an expert in this area and again kind of stats kind of very well done this stuff but but she makes us she brings us up to in their speech to say that basically probably everybody at least knows a person whether they know it or not that has some pedophilic interests according to Madeline most people don't act out on these interests because they know it's illegal and although they never act out on it they will also never be able to talk about it to anybody but sometimes they do and when they do she says we shouldn't hate them or judge them into rocks and offenders houses this is not going to solve this problem we need to be able to talk about it she has to we be a mature society agree that only when we are open about this topic will people be able to you know find the strength to come forward and then will be able to do more research and you know help out society as a whole and that's all from the gist of the written description for the video from watching it I feel like the thrust of Madeline's talk is that a there are different kind of sex offenders which you've already talked about here today be research shows that many pedophiles did not choose to be attracted to kids which we know and see we need to talk about what to do with them and not just immediately go to kill them all well the Internet does not agree almost 180,000 total views for her talk and from a TEDx talk I don't think I've ever seen this thumbs-up thumbs-down ratio so far her video has gotten 1400 thumbs ups 14,000 thumbs MS user Alex posts let's talk about public hangings and why they should return and that comment gets 1400 likes that comment gets as many likes as the video itself got on your snow replies with the guillotine is more classy alright so so not really interested in that let's talk it out angle but I gotta say full disclosure I don't hate these first two comments I don't hate this next one either user for Brizzy Oh posts children are sacred you don't mess with them you don't defend those who do either 1300 thumbs up for president does bring up an important point why are pedophiles the most hated group of people even in prison why are they considered the lowest of the low because they attack the same people that the rest of us work so hard to protect children they prey on the most vulnerable members of society Gordon M post let's legalize murder to 1800 up votes more than the actual video the topic sending the comment section to a violent feeding frenzy which I get it gets my blood boiling as well the illah the illah [ __ ] I can't even read something because they're not real words people's YouTube handles are just [ __ ] made-up nonsense half the time some nonsense word post comment section gives me hope for the future 1800 likes okay so so far for in my opinion soap so far so good at this point starting to think that I guess I'm the idiot of the internet this week because I do agree to some level with everything that I've seen posted so far and you know a green was a lot of comments in a YouTube video thread is typically not not a good thing from what I've seen but then Mountain hare jumps the shark taking this all needlessly into conspiracy bill like people on the web seem to love to do posting this is the end of the quote/unquote rainbow many of us predicted the diversity equality agenda was a tiptoe approach to legitimizing the abuse of innocent children we see the agenda it will be resisted what the [ __ ] you talking about I get it I get it equal opportunity okay day number one I gotta hire minorities okay day number two I can't hate homosexuals indiscriminately day number three everyone's [ __ ] my kids like what are you talking about it's all part of the Illuminati's plan they desperately want to [ __ ] kids and the best way to do that is to normalize pedophilia right which is not what Matt's talking about in her talk by the way she's asking society to think about this issue more work on finding the best solution and in this users like I see what you're doing okay all right you know nothing never hiring you for a babysitter you son of a [ __ ] user Nick Rodriguez furthers this line of thought as a lot of other people did in this thread he posts this is what the Clintons have been waiting for for God's sake laughs like Bill Clinton's at home watching this video just furiously beating off oh yes it's almost here Hillary finally Oh Slick Willy cuz they're [ __ ] the little ones what I've already addressed the Clinton pedophile link and what nonsense it is in the pizza gate suck I don't [ __ ] bite I know some of you don't agree we will forever agree to disagree that to me it's just random slander and propaganda no more valid than the thought of lizard people ruling the earth but so many people in the web they just are they will so wanted to be true they still want the illuminate loominatee to be somehow tied to pedophiles right like that's why people want power so they can just [ __ ] kids that's all they want money and kid [ __ ] user Terry Smith posts in all caps the second time ped X has tried to normalize the abuse of children Ted X supports pedophilia okay now I know a lot of you know that I recently did a TEDx so I do have some insight into this and I and I wish I could say something different this actually is true uh my TEDx will be on YouTube in a few months before I did they did ask me if I would help quote normalize the [ __ ] of kids and I said yeah yeah of course I get it sex the topic of my initial TEDx talk was my sexy summer as an ice cream truck driver slash erotic child photographer and I didn't even get to do that topic because it had been done so many times already so I had to change it to a talk titled secrets how to get the sexiest kids to keep and the TEDx it were like two boners up we loved it actually two TEDx suits came out no clothes they don't wear clothes the meetings and just like did it like swing like flip their boners up when I pop I love it that's how they just that's how they pick actually if you get two boners up then you get your topic no it's [ __ ] of course is not true TEDx it's not and the pedophilia like what they're into is discussion let's talk about complicated issues not just be like [ __ ] I see what you're doing Lebanon let's talk about complicated issues like what to do with sex offenders my TEDx guide if you a guide I guess their mentor if you a wonderful man named Erik and he told me that my talk shouldn't be about providing answers right don't tell people what to think get just get them to think about an interesting issue hopefully in a new way and I do feel like that's what Madeleine did in this talk but the web who clearly did not understand you're not saying I agree with her I don't I don't agree with what seems to be her bias I am harsher on this issue than her but I wasn't like [ __ ] you lady I see what you're doing no he's bringing up a different point user for Brizzy oh we heard from him earlier I I didn't mind him earlier now I do mind him because now he posts when people talked about how normalization of homosexuality was a gateway to this sort of thing they were accused of being paranoid and here we are this old lie man it's [ __ ] well this won't ever go away this old homophobic hate mongering nonsense go lie there is no link between pedophilia and homosexuality right it's all in the same spectrum of sexuality that heterosexuality also exists I know some people just never understand that ever ever ever because a variety of other belief systems but no no no science supports that there being homosexual doesn't make you any more likely than a heterosexual to molest a kid right plenty of heterosexual molesters out there very ignorant thought then smiley attitude goes Captain Obvious I loved Captain Obvious same haven't heard one of these a little while and smiley attitude posts yeah if they're gonna offend then they should be locked far away from children [ __ ] good thought smiley had a great nice to have youth emini thanks for showing up for today if pepper go try murder other people they should not be allowed to do that I'm out contributing my thumb today good one good one and finally use your vest to go post why does this have to show up in the comments so often under this video user vest ago post why is it always all caps Jews pushing for this what are you talking about she never mentioned anything about the Jewish people never mention the she was you don't even know that she is Jewish she might be funny who cares it's it's just when has that been a big Jewish agenda she's one of the Jewish people even had a [ __ ] you know collective agenda right other than to maybe you know have a country to live in but like really to molest kids it just feels like when it comes to the dumbest people on the internet it's like if they're too dumb to think of anything relevant to a post they just post something like this [ __ ] something about you know just like homophobic or something about the Illuminati or like or the Jewish people right if they're just this if they're stumped Island [ __ ] them to understand what the word she is she's using God by war post something I gotta put some stuffing I'm on the computer attack I get something on there oh I'll get I see what you're doing juice the [ __ ] this comment gets likes this comment gets lucky this comment got a hundred and two likes got zero dislikes well no not true I got one dislike because I disliked it thanks idiots way to contribute to today's discussion [Music] okay so do I agree with the whole pedophile Island solution or do I have what I think is a better idea I do have a different idea now hear me out on this this is radical but please fall don't get emotional and please follow the logic on the one hand you have a lot of pedophiles Society doesn't know what to do with thousands and thousands and thousands sex offenders who want to molest kids and it's very expensive to lock them up McNeil Island it costs one hundred and eighty thousand per resident per year costs more to their treatment centers on the other hand there's a lot of kids in orphanages they're having a hard time finding a home and it's expensive to keep them cared for as well so don't freak out what if we put pedophiles in charge of orphanages and just whatever happens happens hear me out they don't get paid but they get what you know they want more than money to get access to kids and we provide we don't provide funding for overseas anymore then they get a chance to have a parent who might not molest that's why I mean that's why I'm saying they might not is that are we not willing to take that chance I mean that's something and that's the most [ __ ] up thing I probably ever sends you now that of course was intentionally [ __ ] that's a terrible idea that's a terrible idea I hope you knew that the whole time I hope you knew the whole time that I knew the whole time that was terrible no but for real for real what do we do well while the trampling of some constitutional rights concerns me regarding the whole premise of continuing to keep someone locked up even after they've served their sentence you know the thought of letting people out of a prison who are attracted to harming children who are attracted to raping adults or sexually torturing people like a Ted Bundy type person that thought bothers me more you know paraphilias like penta feel it's a mental disorder only with this mental disorder you don't wash your hands way too often her or feel far too sad or hear voices when you don't get treated you [ __ ] kids you know you forget to take your bipolar medication the consequences will affect others in the way we have to deal with someone who's very depressed or unnaturally up I mean there could be the consequences of suicide but even that is very different than forgetting to take your meds and [ __ ] a couple of kids one weekend I mean I mean do you see what I'm saying pedophilia is disordered that the experts admit we have no cure for counselling and supervision the odds that you'll relapse and molest someone but they don't cure it compared to alcoholism some alcoholics are able to go to meetings weekly or daily for years surround themselves with a good support system never touch a drink again sometimes they fall off the wagon and they get drunk sometimes for the rest of life so nice for a day a week a month or a year and that's tough for them and that's tough for their friends and families but it's not as tough as if as if when they fell off the wagon they started molesting or raping a pedophile falls off the wagon someone gets sexually assaulted someone's innocence is taken someone is given brutally painful memories they can never erase or worse someone dies I honestly feel bad for pedophiles if they are in fact born that way that's [ __ ] that's terrible how terrible truly truly terrible to be born attracted to kids or attracted to sadistic torture that's in fact what has happened I also feel terrible for a dog who doesn't get vaccinated against rabies and then gets rabies that's [ __ ] sucks for that dog it's not that dog's fault but in order to keep others safe that dog has to die that dog has to be put down for that for the jet for the greater good of general society I feel the same way about violent high-risk pedophiles I'm sorry that you're wired that way but you're too much of a threat to continue to get to live in the general population Wesley Alan Dodd knew that he knew he had to be removed to keep society safe maybe someday there will be a cure some surgery to rewire one's brain to eliminate this compulsion and if that happens hurray for society hurray for science but until then I think locking these predators up in special commitment centers like pedophile Isle is probably the best way to go I don't like them to be privately owned I'll just say that I personally I'm against that private prison that's a whole other suck I don't want to go down that road too far but but but I I do think they should be locked up and also I'll take it further I don't think they should be allowed to just hang out and receive treatment I think they should have to work they should have to build something they should have to make something profitable and that's something you know that this is being sold the profits of that something should be split between the victims they've harmed and the fame you know of the victims Department if you know those victims are deceased and with nonprofits that further help the victims of sexual abuse and if anyone is not willing to do that not willing to help out and help you know contribute some some money to towards research or something well the good night [ __ ] rope or the bullet you sexually abuse others and then refuse to work to help alleviate the damage you've done in my opinion you absolutely deserve to [ __ ] die you're the lowest of the low you have no right to be part of society you've chosen to do nothing but bring pain to society pain and damage so [ __ ] you get off our planet Hale [ __ ] Nimrod time for top five takeaways number one the McNeil Island special commitment Center aka pedophile island was open to the Puget Sound two miles off the coast of Tacoma Washington in April of 1990 first facility of its kind in America initially housed only a handful of offenders today there are more than 5200 high-risk sex offenders civilly committed in the United States and 20 different states number two pedophile Island was created in response to Washington's passage of the community Protection Act of 1990 the Act was passed because of several incidents of previously convicted sex offenders who served short sentences killing a woman and some children and brutal fashion in the late 80s most notably the horrific crimes of Wesley Allen dot number three the stats vary but at the very least hundreds of thousands of children molested hundreds of thousands of additional women are raped in the US alone every single year number four currently there is no cure for pedophilia and other destructive paraphilias such as rap to philia the sexual attraction towards rape itself number five new info if you look into a cure for pedophilia you will very likely quickly stumble upon the research of one psychiatrist Paul Federoff of the University of Ottawa he published a paper in December of two thousand eighteen titled can people with pedophilia change yes they can Fedorov perspective is that pedophilia is not a sexual orientation instead he characterizes it as a sexual interest or something that a person just happens to want to do sexually sexual interest he says is something that we acquire from learning and observation and as such is changeable throughout life Fedorov actually goes as far to say that there is no evidence to suggest that sexual interest is different in terms of change ability compared to for example interest and vegetarianism or kale or oysters in other words in his view just as you can continually learn new food preferences you can learn new sexual preferences you know one day maybe you want some enchiladas maybe the next day you want a kids but you know you like [ __ ] Taco Tuesday you like Friday kid wing uh uh-huh so convinced that this idea is Federoff that he said now I routinely tell new patients with pedophilia that their prognosis is excellent and then they can expect to have no evidence of disease in less than a year but is this true it doesn't [ __ ] seem so none of his peers to my knowledge seem to agree with him on any in any way whatsoever you know I I hope he's found something hope he's found something that no one else understands yet maybe he has I don't think so maybe yes but even if he has until longitudinal studies have been done regarding the recidivism of rape of those who have undergone this treatment after five years ten years twenty years and longer until then get to the [ __ ] island whoo pedophile Island has been sucked hail to the patreon space lizards for supporting the show and picking that topic I would have never found it otherwise until we find a cure for molesters separation of society or death are the only rational options in my opinion for dealing with the problem of high risk sex offenders violent sexual predators offenders attracted to the offenses that they commit thank you to the time so team thanks to queen of the suck Lindy Cummings High Priestess of the suck harmony Bella camp Jessie Guardian of grammar

groundhogs Jesse said I've only heard them call that in South Idaho I've heard other people or I've gotten messages from other people in the Midwest so now we know what a whistle pig is it's a

Nimrod and coward elusive phenom listen to the Black Panthers suck and I'm in your opening comments you said happy Black History Month to your ma to your melatonin enhanced friends the word you're looking for is melanin dammit ah melatonin is associated with sleep melanin is the chemical to determine skin shade sorry for busting your ass I'm as well just a white meat sack what's important to know the difference keep on Slyke it is important I got a lot of messages about that as I should have melanin not melatonin those words are pretty close those words are pretty close but yeah very different meanings so thank you for that another Black Panther message coming from time sucker Tiffany Tiffany says good morning suck master comments first let me say you did a hell of a job sucking on the Black Panthers this melon dated meat sack was very elated at your unbiased presentation I must say I was a little hesitant as to how they were going to be portrayed since a lot of our history has been whitewashed and watered down damn it by the power Bojangles you [ __ ] did it I just have one correction to the story it may be minor but to me it's very significant yes and many people wrote about this as well as you were telling the story of Malcolm X who stated his father was Marcus Garvey this is incorrect although the story of the story of how his father was killed was correct his father's name was Earl little Marcus Garvey was a political activist and leader from Jamaica again I know just a minor part of the story just I you should know thank you for taking the time to read my email continued to suck on Haley subpoena Hale Bojangles and then also black power in my hillbilly voice your loyal time circle listener Tiffany from Arizona yeah I do love that white he'll be going back um yeah so yeah Cole mistakes thanks for sending those in Black Panther episode insight from law enforcement sucker James Pitts who writes it hey Dan look you know I'm a white guy in law enforcement and frankly I'll save you the I'm not racist and here are some facts blah blah blah I just want to ask you and possibly other spaces what will break the [ __ ] cycle of this madness it seems like both sides are fighting against one another for the sins of their fathers I lobby against every time we have a community outreach which basically means let's go to the hood and talk to the kids and this is why we as law enforcement do not need to convince children we aren't bad people or racist it's the parents and grandparents we need to reach out to in predominantly black and Latino neighborhoods they are the pillars of their communities and that children will listen to them the parents and elders of these communities aren't the ones being arrested on a nightly basis and then resist and fight with us every single [ __ ] night whom are predisposed to fearing and hating us it is almost always men under 30 this is the part where I rant for white people so you can skip this till you see if you keep on sucky okay well you know I I feel like I used to it's really good things here though you know the media does not help this because they love to report white cop black suspect stories and television movies has made it an encouraged ideal to make slight comments about white people yesterday I'm watching one of my favorite movies ironically it's Marvel's Black Panther and the Black Panther sister makes a comment another broken white boy I gotta fix I'm watching this and I don't get angry but I cannot help but think what was the point of that comment there are tons of other examples and please understand I'm not trying to bitching Mona promise anyway I feel that you will understand not necessarily agree with me and can tell me if I'm wrong in the sense just wanted to get that off my chest I'm sure you will get a ton of emails about today's black panther suck I will leave the rest to you you did a great job appreciate your support and your criticisms about today keep on sucking the Hilda Nimrods and then I asked you I asked him so I could share his email instead you can share as much of it as you like names at all I want every one of every type to succeed in life and hope everyone I come in contact with especially at work exceeds me in success also I tell everyone that is up for release do better than me thanks for the reply and how great I mean I love you James and you know what no I agree with you man on stuff it's just not helpful it's not helpful that's when you know in in the in the aim of creating more equality for one group another group then becomes continually [ __ ] on because then all you do is just continually perpetuate the cycle of this group gets to [ __ ] on this group then that group gets mad and then they eventually start [ __ ] more on the group and then that group gets mad and it's over and over and over and endlessly until you know with Rachael quality we just like know everybody should [ __ ] succeed everybody and then it shouldn't matter that's what I argue for I'm not real into me person I make jokes about like you know Lindsay polish history yet I think heritage is cool but when but when people go bonkers with it and and then it starts to feel to me like okay well now I can't be close to you because you care so much about your heritage that it kind of puts get this this attitude off to me of like well and [ __ ] everybody else's heritage my heart is just the best no team meets at [ __ ] that's it that's it that's it if you're a human you know if you're a good person if you're a good person if you're not a [ __ ] pedophile then I don't care what your skin color is another black panther's update from time sucker Akiba Howard she says well I Melissa oh yes sorry wait kiba I I

you did on the Panthers deserves recognition you are a white man white man who lives in Idaho goodness goodness knows you live in the heart of whiteness yeah I can't fight it but despite that this episode showed you get it you understand while you were off and on that's understandable considering well your white guy the point is you said things need to be said and for that I thank you and I salute that's very nice cube thank you thanks for taking the time to send that message another message about the Black Panthers from Jody Jones who says as a black meatsack you did get on the Panthers

sucker wrote I'm a civilian employee of the Virginia State Police and a faithful disciple to suck I listen to every episode even when I'm unsure if I'm interested in the topic as it turns out I always

last thing I expected to hear this was the last thing I spoke to you and I started to cry Wilson to my desk thank you so much for acknowledging his sacrifice I did not know him personally but often saw his name on paperwork and occasionally saw him around during certain events the past week has been very hard for everyone with Virginia State Police but hearing that someone went off at another state cares about his life and shares our grief it gives more comfort than you can imagine thanks for emphasizing that there are many good law enforcement officers out there and that they deserve

X2yZgmgrQF0,on the phone it is a pleasure to welcome Nikko Hines he's the London editor of The Daily Beast and we are talking to him in London at the moment Nikko welcome to the program so this this story is incredibly disturbing that you've published in The Daily Beast I guess it was about a week ago it is about a VIP paedophile Network that was I guess I don't know embedded is the right word but it was within the British government tell us how this this story came to light well how it come out is a really important part of this whole alleged cover-up all the way back in the mid 1980s and there were allegations and rumors about senior members of the British government and about what they may or may not have been getting up to in their private time you have to remember this is a very different world back then the homosexuality had only been legalized relatively recently and the age of consent was 21 so there was a kind of a shadowy ke world in any case so some of these kind of more serious or I shouldn't comparison but because there was a veil of secrecy and a veil of criminality and some people's private lives this was somehow allowed to go on unchecked yet there were rumors now media newspapers some of whom tried to cover this at the time but they were never able to either because the police rushed in to stop them or just because of Britain's very strict libel laws if you're going to make an accusation that somebody was breaking the law and in such a serious way you have to have a lot of proof in all this bill to back up your assertion now so this this this scandal or I should say this this paedophile Network we're not talking I mean are you are you saying that the the we're talking about 20 year olds and it is or are we talking about young children here no we're talking about people from the earliest age that I've seen in the allegations has gone to the police about nine years old so yeah we're talking about serious serious claims the reason I mentioned the older people is just because it gives some context to understand there was a place called dolphin square which was which is located near Westminster near the houses and a lot of MPs lived there because obviously they have their lane owned in the parts of the country that they come from and that they represent them when they're in London to do political business they have flats in this place and it was known that there were some gay parties that had older people in them that were partially secret but what is now being alleged is that there were in fact serious pedophile rings also operating in this okay so let me let me get let me let me just see if I can I can clarify your point here is that because this was at a time where there was I guess essentially gay people were emancipated in some way at least in the context of the law that there was still sort of these vestiges of a a social I guess perspective where you don't really look into what's going on in the personal lives of people because what they may be engaged in may be technically illegal but is not necessarily problematic and some of that I guess modus operandi sort of intersected with what was a which was clearly a different species ie you know pedophilia but those sort of constructs were still sort of like we're blurred because of that it just gave a cover story so you knew that people MP senior MPs who works for the Margaret Thatcher government we're going off doing things that they didn't on everyone to know about but you just kind of assumed that it was something that was technically illegal or perhaps round upon or you know this is a common there weren't publicly gay MPs so you just imagined that what they were doing was actually perfectly reasonable behavior even if it was technically illegal but in fact it now turns out that there were serious crimes being committed okay so in 1983 you write Geoffrey Dickens a controversial MP I'm not clear obviously as an American I'm not two up on my on the the profiles of members of parliament particularly in the 80s but the odds for that matter but he handed a file containing the names of alleged perpetrators to Leon Brittan who was Leon Brittan the Home Secretary which I suppose the most similar position in the u.s. would be kind of director of Homeland Security or something like that someone who's in charge of Britain's police Britain's intelligence agencies but also kind of border control so a very very very influential person in terms of someone who was able to put in place kind of was able to use his influence to make sure that those law enforcement agencies were following his well okay and and so what did he do with this would this I guess this this file of claims hotly contested things that's one and run on this now Geoffrey Dickens publicly said that there was a suggestions of there being a pedophile ring in London amongst politicians at the time now most people thought you know Geoffrey Dickens was a kind of outspoken flamboyant kind of guy most people thought he was probably exaggerating or that they'd gotten the wrong end of the stick nobody necessarily took his claims seriously nonetheless he passed his his dossier of evidence to Leon Brittan my own separate and nothing publicly was ever heard again from that now we subsequently found out that he wrote to Geoffrey Dickens and later to explain that his officials did find enough evidence in there to consider it worthwhile to carry out further investigations but that's the last that we hear about it the whereabouts of that file has is a great mystery there was an investigation last year ordered by the current British government to try and discover where that fire was and that file has been destroyed now we don't know who destroyed it we don't know when it was destroyed but the fact that it is no longer in existence okay and we should say that this this guy Briton Leon Brittan has passed away I mean is that why okay and then tell us who Don Hale is and and what was his role in I guess this revelation newspaper editor he worked in Barry so outside of London and the reason he kind of comes into the story is because he's one of his local politicians who was a senior naval politician at the time went to him and said look I've got evidence about these Peter phone rings now she wasn't necessarily saying that these people all active Peters also she was saying that there was a group called the paedophile information exchange which was working with in Westminster kind of promoting or working for to improve Rights for pedophiles she had evidence that these people were working with in weaving Westminster she wanted the big national press to run a story about it but they were all too scared to run a story about it so she went to her local MP sorry her local newspaper a guy who she knew well done Hale and gave him and that evidence he was skeptical and at least worried about how he'd be able to use the story but he thought at least this thing I can do is like a monastery saying you know well-known local politician barber Castle is worried that there's a pedophile ring in Westminster and she says that it's being investigated by the British government he thought he'd get away with doing that so he started to make a few calls to those some of those people named in the dossier you know sooner did he do that but any politician arrived at the office the very next morning threatening him shouting at him demanding that he hand over the files he refused to hand over those files and then the very next day and police officers from something called Special Branch which is a sort of high up intelligence cold war-era police super squad arrived at the office and took away all the papers took away all the evidence and said that if he were to ever repeat anything that was found within these stolen documents that he would be jailed Wow and so he he didn't I mean how did how do we know his story today well he considered thinking he decided that you know it was a fair cop in a sense because he knew that these documents were stolen or at least we're not supposed to have been shown outside of the Home Office they had you there for your eyes only and classified written on the papers so he knew it was true that he would could get in trouble if he used them and he didn't have any way to prove that these allegations were true so even when he was approached a few years later by the news of the world the famous tabloid newspaper in Britain and blowing from Murdoch about similar allegations he refused to repeat them again then because he was afraid you know he had a family didn't want to go to jail it was only when this story began to really explode in 2012 in Britain when an MP used parliamentary privilege which means you're allowed to make claim against that ended would be considered libelous written in the newspaper it was published or discussed in the radio he used parliamentary privilege to say in the British House of Commons that some of these allegations ought to be examined and that then kicked into gear the British media into really investigating him really examining some of these things and the crucial difference is that quite a lot of these men have subsequently died and so you're now able to repeat some of these allegations which we never proved in a court of law at the time Wow and so I mean and he and so following I guess the the member of the House of Commons sort of saying that we need to more investigation this hail reports this stuff where where is it where where are we now with this or I should say before we get to that how much did Margaret Thatcher I mean how high up did this go that's again something that more and more details of that are emerging as the week's go on at the moment because people are plunging back through the archives and finding old reports finding or classified files and individuals who were involved with Margaret Thatcher are starting to speak out so we had a body one of her bodyguards has come out and said that he warned her about one of her close aides that lots of allegations were made against him we know that Sir Peter Heyman who was one of the top guys mi6 but he named one of Britain's main spy agencies was also caught with Peter for material we know that she was told about that and we can see in her in her hand on a note that was found earlier this year that she says that this shouldn't be made public and then just wait a second I'm sorry what is that last part this she found there was a no OA note that she wrote in her and her handwriting that's right saying that this shouldn't be made public so she knew that these allegations have been made she knew that this guy was responsible not for abusing children but for having pedophile obscene materials and she and she wrote to one of her advisers oh no no no let's make sure this doesn't this doesn't come out it then emerged this weekend that another of these high-profile abusers a man called steel Smith and I advise your listeners to look him up because he's one of the most extraordinary looking him you'll ever see huge fat man weighed about 400 pounds and that used to wear kind of the big bracelet and suspenders he looked he looked kind of like a cartoonish figure of a bad guy and it turned out he wasn't that guy something what something like several hundred complaints were filed against him by boys over a period of decades and again she was she was warned that allegations have been made against him of this nature and she went ahead and gave him a knighthood anyway so he he died as Smith so what is happening I mean how much is this I mean I had your story frankly is the only reporting I've read about this in this in the states here there may be other pieces I just haven't I haven't come across them it's certainly not a story that is making big ribbon so how big of a the story is this in Great Britain I mean it I mean it just seems I mean there's two things that seem really sort of shocking to me one is the cover-up two is you know what why are there so many pedophiles in in and around these governmental positions I mean this is just yeah I it just seems bizarre to me in both instances but what what kind of response are you getting in Great Britain it's one of those things that bubbled and bubbles and bubbled and it's actually I think the it's one of the upsides of the Internet and people being able to publish information and share information in a way that was never possible before so what you had in there the eighties and perhaps in the early 1990s was newspapers hearing rumors hearing suggestions and perhaps even hearing firsthand evidence from one or two people one or two victims someone that abused them or has broken them or in some way but not necessarily there being no photographic evidence or there being no video evidence so it's very difficult with libel laws to be able to report that the what's now happened is that people who either survivors themselves or who the kind of self-appointed sleuth has put together a lot of the missing information into great folders and file and websites where they created this evidence and and it's only become apparent that you know that there were so many people active at the same time well it's hot I'm sorry good no we'll just because major newspapers were afraid to do it and because frankly you know as you found yourself it just doesn't sound believable it doesn't sound but it could be true and how could you possibly write that some of the most senior people in the country are pedophiles just based on the word of one of the children who you can't prove by telling the truth so is there I guess I mean in my mind it would cause me to - I guess question two things one is I mean just a fundamental question of just you know well there's all sorts of issues of what else you know how many other people are being protected for what and in what dynamic and how long this has been going on etcetera etc and I want to address that in a second but what about the libel laws I mean I don't know that Americans are quite aware of just how different your libel law situation is in Great Britain and I wonder if people are questioning the the the value of those or whether or not they need to be reformed in some way because the idea that this could go on and people would be afraid of reporting it seems to me very problematic and a lot of people do you think that there's also a kind of counter-argument I don't know whether you guys has followed we had this big scandal over here and you know Joseph Murdoch and a lot of the British tabloids have come under fire for writing too much making too many salacious claims about celebrities and about people so there's also a strong counter movement as it were but you know I think you can you can look too much into blaming why weren't the media reporting on this and perhaps there's a valid point in that but what the real crux of is why won't the police investigating this why wasn't why won't these people coming up in court because there was evidence people like Cyril Smith was caught with hardcore pornography in his car and yet was allowed to walk through from a police station because there was a phone call from someone in some high-powered office in London they told the local police officers odd you know what do a favor just let this guy walk on his way is there is there has there been any I guess rethink I mean do you think oh that Rose legacy and I don't know that it really I don't know how how great her legacy is frankly anyways in Great Britain for that matter but I mean is this going to impact her legacy and is there are people talking about some form of reform within the government structures I mean there was a quote that you that you used in your piece which as I was reading it I said this sounds like it would be from house of cards in fact it was a storyline pretty close in house of cards from basically a whip saying you know when when members of parliament come to us with these type of problems we're excited about it because it means we help them out and now we own these guys essentially is there any any talk of like we got to figure out a way to make sure that that can't happen and what we have got now and even this in itself has become a massive problem is there's a an enormous inquiry has been launched into harness has covered up how this went on that was announced over a year ago I think now and yet has not even sat for a single hearing yet because there's been so many arguments about who's gonna be in charge and who being able to be responsible for making sure ins as an honest and open inquiry eventually we've they had to get rid of to panel potential kind of judges who were going to be in charge of it because it turned out that they were friends or lived in the same neighborhood for some of the men who were supposedly caught up in it so we've now got a judge from New Zealand who's been kind of who's going to be flown over as an independent adjudicator and it will be her job to go through and to examine how these things were allowed to happen and what should be done in order to make sure that they don't happen again yeah it's crazy and it just seems to me to that you know in this instance it is pedophilia but one wonders how many other violations crimes scandals are quashed or investigations of which are quashed so that these can be used as chits of power in the future yeah absolutely I'm sure it happens a lot in the u.s. perhaps not from these particular grounds but I'm sure similar things happen but it's always been worth in Britain I think because you know we do have a different kind of a society here I don't know if you've seen any of those pictures school pictures as David Cameron and Boris Johnson are London there and George Osborne our top treasury guy you know they were all friends at university they were going went to school it's similar schools it's not the same school and we've got a real problem in Britain and other kind of establishments in a way that I suppose you know the Clintons would aspire to when is a kind of closed part of society who've known each other all their lives and yes when one of them gets in trouble they're going to close ranks and they're gonna try and look out for each other try and make sure that not just because they want to do them a favor as friends or colleagues but because they think that it would look bad to the rest of watching Britain's if it turns out that people who were in this establishment maybe you shouldn't be trusted in the way that they are it's fascinating and you know just go if if molesting and abusing small children is is not enough to have people in your social circle say you know we should we should blow the whistle on this so one wonders what else they can get away with but I appreciate your time Nikko Hines the pieces in The Daily Beast I presume hopefully we'll see more reporting from you going forward on this because it's a just a really just bizarre and fascinating disturbing story I appreciate your coming on talk to us about it interesting all right well we will we will check that out and of course we're going to link to your first piece that majority FM all right Nikko Hines thanks so much for your time today you ,3

thanks for coming on the show no problem having me your team and I appreciate that no problem yeah a fairly busy man well thank goodness really cuz when I started out on this journey 30 years ago um you know there weren't a lot of people who were interested in talking about these subjects and it was a very lonely road then but now as you say it's finding time to to talk to all the people that want to want to discuss this stuff so so we have made progress much as the world needs to make a lot more we have made progress in terms of people are now now more open to looking at things that they would have waved away by reflex action before so it's all it's all good yeah good and we'll touch on that 50 years ago you made that decision to speak openly about the things that you believe then which takes massive cottage so massive respect for that and I think people don't understand that to believe in something that no one else understands or to servicios things that people don't understand you have Coakley's and you said it yourself you were ridiculed and we'll go right back to the start of your life how it started where you were brought up and how you get involved and the stuff you're involved and no gold at all you got the I was born on a council estate in Leicester when we brother still lives in the same house in 1952 and we were skinned but you know it's a funny thing we were skinned and things were incredibly tight but I'd ever felt deprived you know you you you made your own fun and and stuff you didn't need a thing to do it you didn't need computers or smartphones and you you had to use your imagination and and you had to do things without any money and but I enjoyed my childhood I was watching steam trains and playing football and I know and I enjoyed it and I didn't perceive myself as deprived even though you know we were literally from week to week I I'm one of my earliest memories he's going around the back of the clock factory where my father worked on a Thursday lunchtime when he got paid and he would nip out the back didn't want to let anyone else see him to give me mother the pay packet he just had so we could eat that night it was that tight um you know I remember as a kid you would I didn't even realize for a long time why it was but the door would knock and then my mother would say quick Shh and she you should take us around the back of the sofa and we I'd be on the sofa and I'm a little boy what's going on and what was happening is the rent man would knock on the door and if there's no answer he'd go to the front window and looking look inside so we right so but but but oh you know I it wasn't you felt deprived and I I love my childhood and you know I wouldn't change it and that's always kind of that attitude to life was always stayed with me you know I'm not someone who you know looks down on people yeah because they don't have money or they don't appear so don't have that because I've been there and for me we're all individual expressions of the same consciousness just having different experiences and we should start supporting each other and seeing as all as as one consciousness having different experiences instead of self identifying with all these buddy labels you know for me that the world is controlled and humanity is controlled and controls itself and creates the very ground for which divide and rule is it possible which allows the few to control the many through its obsession with labels so we say your work I remember that that great scene on on the old David Frost program where you had the three guys John Cleese was one and and Ronnie Ronnie Barker and Ronnie Corbett were that were the others and there were different sizes and and John Cleese Whizzer was was dressed as out rich man in the nice suit and then you had Ronnie Barker next one down he was kind of middle class in a trilby and then you had Ronnie Corbett little little guy on the end and he was kind of working-class with the flat cap you know or the cliches and and it was a wonderful thing the describing the way that labels dictate our interaction where one saying I look down on him because I am upper-class and then the guy in the middle was saying and I looked down on him because he is lower class and we both look up on him because he's upper-class and these labels and labels of race labels of sexuality labels of religion and and these are not who we are they are experiences that our consciousness is having our awareness is having and once you start self identifying with the label you start looking at yourself in terms of little me I am my label I am Ethel who works on the checkout at Tesco that's all I am no you are an expression of infinite awareness having an experience called Ethel on the checkout you know bill driving the bus you know you say to people who are you that you say well I'm bill I come from Manchester and I Drive a bus no no that's what you're experiencing bill is the name of your current experience what you are is consciousness having that experience and this might seem like esoteric navel-gazing but it's not it's a totally different way of interacting with the world and it's a total different way of self identifying yourself because when you when you say I M R and the labels then follow you are self identifying with limitation you're self identifying I am my experience and if I'm you know born in Leicester in a working-class council house then that that defines me that's that's who I have no no that's just where you were born you have the potential to be whatever you want to want to be and whatever you you you choose to be but what we've what we've got now is a massive extension even of that whereby your label is everything not only dirt there are people defining themselves by the labels the world is increasingly defining them more than ever before by them and this is where what we what we call today identity politics comes from where it's not about what is right or fair or just which is surely the way to look at anything it's how does this affect my label so if I'm transgender and something happens how does this affect my label if I'm this race or that race or that religion or that religion and something happens well how does this affect my label so people are constantly judging the world by how it affects their label instead of saying well done minute never mind all that is it right is it fair is it just no matter what labor is talking we're talking about is it fair is it just is it is it right and so what you have is a situation where we have developed this this belief among increasing numbers of people particularly young people through the universities and colleges whereby you judge everyone by a group and then you tag the group whether it's good or not good so therefore instead of seeing a world of individuals with individual thoughts opinions observations you judge everyone by a group so if you say something about one group you're a bigger you're a Nazi and a racist or or a fascist and if you say something about another group then and that group is labeled bad then you say what you bloody like about that we spoke about that le David if people are divided from religion from race that he's at they control the masses at ease that they can throw because everybody's fainting and arguing who's been I'm sorry and for me personally but all we call gold deserve a chance and to say at limits on yourself you're crazy because everything has limitless you're the one who can control and take whatever you wanted to believe for new man you start to judge on that David obviously you went through the Terry walking show which was massive for you because you come on not sure and you spoke out how you believed then and the things that you seen and you things you about educating yourself West because you always say they did the kilcher which I believe was it's sad when you watch that and of you am when you're working on that did you know that that was going to be the outcome yeah it's kind of funny um people people people said to me didn't you know that what happened if you said this and said that and I thought I said what do you know I'd worked that out but you say it anyway but but you see there's a lot of background with that because I was I was going through my life I left school at 15 I didn't take a major exam because I went to be a professional footballer with Coventry and and and others and then my career ended with rheumatoid arthritis I played a whole year of league football with rheumatoid arthritis that's whole story and in itself but what that did is it developed it developed in you because all these things are within us an experience brings them out and if you don't have experience often they don't come out so um I have this phrase um life tends to give us our greatest gifts brilliantly disguised as our worst nightmares because often our worst nightmare will will bring things out of us that wouldn't otherwise happen this is why if you if you bring your kids up and you protect them from everything you're doing them no favors because you're not developing strong people who will be able to deal with life you're developing people who are always looking to be protected and look look at what we have now and once you have a generation or or you have a population that wants to be protected and perceives itself all the time as being a victim where is the power a point of power move it moves to Authority because people look to Authority to protect them from what their fear or what they feel victimized by so what we have we've been developing is a population of emotionally weak people who perceive themselves in terms of victims when you have challenges in life and you meet them it brings something out of you so for instance when my my arthritis came and I didn't know what what else am I gonna do at that time I wanted to be a footballer I wanted be a footballer since I was a kid and now I'll be joints to swelling up and they're telling me I'm gonna have to pack it in now I've thought I'm not packing it in I want to give it a go so I went to a club called he referred United that was a league club then and I played the whole season with rheumatoid arthritis every morning when we were training and warming up for training on cold English mornings I was in agony and and and I would be limping and what-have-you and players were say oh what's wrong now I can die I would give a different excuse all got a bit of a pall oh I've got a bit of a blister but actually was the same thing all the kind and I played the season out and eventually got so bad that I couldn't carry on but he brought something out of me this this determination not not to give up and not to give in and then I I decided because when I was a kid I I was always reading newspapers and I was very interested in journalism so I became a journalist and long story short I eventually became a television presenter whoever had a well known back then yeah I was yeah I was I was a national television per century in those days which when I look at my life now you see and and what I'm doing my life before which appeared to be a series of random events same with you you've had your challenges their life what is it done it's made you the person you are you wouldn't be the person you are now without them and people say well I regret that or regret that well the thing to regret is if you don't learn from the experience that's the regret but learning from the experience well you've had a gift what you've written for and so I I went into journalism because I was very interested in that and I've actually became this television presenter and when you look at my life as I was saying um all the different elements of it including going into journalism and seeing the media for what it is going into politics with the Green Party and seeing politics for what it is what I didn't know at the time but they were all giving me very very important understandings that will be useful later on and then what happened is yes this is a kind of bizarre story but it happened I was I was in the Green Party and and I and I was still working for the BBC television presenter and both were leaving me completely cold you know the the the the beep the BBC it's it's not a great organization to work for if you care about the truth and you care about you know more than the official version of everything and I also was looking at the Green Party politics from the inside and seeing that it was just like every other party and so I was what do I do with my life now because I can't go on with either of these and what happened was a very strange thing happened because in the early part of what would it be 1989 I started having this feeling that when I was in a room alone I wasn't alone and it's like this it's like this there was an atmosphere there this there's something there and through 1989 this this got more and more and more powerful to the point where in early 1990 I was working for the BBC and I was it I was staying at a hotel called Kassadin Hilton just down for the BBC headquarters and I'm sitting on the side of the bed and in in this apparently empty room and and there there was such a sense of a presence there that I said into the room you know if there's something there would you please contact me because you'll drive me up the wall few days later I'm on the seafront with my son Gareth little boy then in ride where I live on the are white and I I go into this news agent shop where gas was looking at one of the books and I said to him come on guys we'll come and get some lunch in the town and and as I said it it was like the atmosphere changed like the energetic field around me changed and all I heard it wasn't it wasn't a voice it was a very strong thought form it said go and look at the books on the far side and I'm standing there thinking you know do not shut your so yeah that basically whatever so I start walking across to the books in inner inner day's thinking what is happening and I knew this bookshop that the books it sold were for you know the tourists had come to the art of white they were basically Mills and Boon and and and you know perfectly form English roses and having relationships with perfectly formed you know uniformed soldiers and all this stuff so I'm thinking what am I going over here for but right in the middle of these books was one called mind to mind by a woman called Betty shiner a picture was on the front it was different to the other side picked it up and I turn it over and I read the blurb and she was a psychic an English psychic and she was telling her life story so I bought the book read it in 24 hours found it very interesting contacted her because I wanted to go and see if she would pick up what the hell was happening around me for the last year and so I went I told her nothing what I told it was because she did this hands-on healing as well which is just an exchange of energy you know it's not mumbo-jumbo it's an exchange of energy okay yes it's just an exchange of energy that's what it is but anyway um I told her that because I said I've got arthritis maybe it will help because I didn't want to give anything away or what's happening to me so I'm sitting on this bench this medical-type bench in her front room you know she chatting away and she's doing that whole you know hands-on healing just next to my left knee and suddenly the atmosphere changed again and I felt like a spider's web on my face now what hit me was in her book she said when other levels of reality are trying to lock into you you sometimes feel like a spider's web when you face well I know what that what that was now it's electromagnetic energy you know you know when you you you you're in a crowd a football crowd with great emotional excitement you you feel like a charge of energy the hair stands up net you know that's electromagnetic fit their electromagnetic fields so that's what I was feeling but it did feel like a spider's web on the face and I said nothing but to the to the to the to Betty but I'm thinking what the hell and then about 10 or 15 seconds later she reels her head back and she said my god this is powerful I've got to close my eyes for this one I'm he bombs for going further down there what have you got to do yourself into here I key and she starts telling me in March 1990 there I'm gonna go out on a world stage and reveal great secrets I would face enormous opposition but they whatever that is would always be there to protect me and that there there was a shadow over the world that and there was a story that needed to be told that you manatee was gonna was going to go through a phase of waking up and coming out of basically its coma which is programming and that I was gonna go out and do that one man cannot change the world but one man can communicate the message that can change the world was one of the things she said and I'm sitting there I'm a television presenter for the BBC I'm a national spokesman for the Green Party and I'm thinking what are you talking so I then leave leave leave her and get on a train she lived near Hassocks in Sussex and and and or in her six actually and and then I drove up or went up in the train to present a television program but from that moment on what one of the things that was said that she said because she said the first thing she said she had no idea about this interaction in the Kensington Hill she's saying that they're telling me they know you you wanted them to contact you but the time wasn't right and you you you know now you've been brought here to be contacted and they said they're saying that you're gonna be led to knowledge and at other times knowledge will be put into your mind all right okay what so anyway after see at that time David the Jew think she was maybe crazy because you know understand that I'll be gee I don't work because when you speaker but stuff like that people go well he's maybe crazy but yeah again it's judging people and everybody's in their own different paths yeah I mean what I've been like may all my life is um I've never dismissed things that I can't know absolutely are not true I I have this policy I put things on the back burner and I see what comes and if more information comes to support it more incomplete nation comes to support it there comes a point where there's so much information supporting that that it crosses the line and you know you start to say okay I accept this is what's happening but I don't just dismiss things and never have on the basis that they're different just being the way I've always been was at the start of your John that end going unless women and everything like her weaken and I smell bacon yes yeah it was and and you know one of the one of the things was that you know it was going to be tough and and so when I left that left her house and got only life very very quickly synchronicity coincidences started to occur where I'd meet people come across information come across books come across documents whatever that was starting to like hand me puzzle pieces and I started to realize as it built up and it built up and it built up that actually the world was not like I thought it was well not like I thought it was really have you on that I just put in Washington I never did believe that politicians around the world I always felt there was something else but you didn't even you didn't know what it was now I was beginning to understand question everything works yeah and another thing that happened is that I would get just a knowing that this is how I think this is what's going on here and then what would follow would be names dates places hard factual information that would support that view which kind of connects with we will put knowledge into his mind and this has gone on now for 30 years and it's gone through different different phases of information and it's taken me down a an extraordinary road of uncovering the world as it is behind the facade of what we're told it is and of course it's taken me into realms of enormous ridicule and enormous abuse but we come back to the greatest gift are often that you ever given is your worst nightmare or what appears to be so if we go back to the Wogan show because what happened eventually is i went on the wagon show and talked about what was happening to me and at that time I was right in that period of the whoa good shows period of about three months I was going through an enormous transformation of that you doesn't understand I didn't understand no because this is what happened just very very very briefly is that I I suddenly got this feeling that I needed to go to Peru I didn't know why I never been there I watched him play in the World Cup a few times but I didn't know anything about it and long story short I ended up in Peru and and not as series of enormous ly amazing things happen to me and it culminated at a place called Cu star knee which is near a place called puno near Lake Titicaca highest navigable lake in the world they say about 13,000 feet and and I ended up and a series of synchronicities again at this so-called Inca site called Cu star knee which is all Inca ruins on a hill and there's a lake and mountains right in the middle of nowhere and I went and I looked around it and then I'd hired this taxi and this guide came with me and we're driving away from Cu starting and I'm just daydreaming which I do all the time daydreaming out the window he sold mine wandering and I'm looking at this hill as we're coming towards it and as I looked at this hill all I could hear in my head was come to me come to me come to me you know and I'm thinking you know I was introducing I was introducing the snooker not long ago actually and now this freakin Hills talking to me Steve Davis Jimmy White all is forgiven and so I asked the guy to stop I said I won't be a minute I'm going up that hill and I walked up the hill and I didn't know where I was going or why and um there's this all these kind of stones it's kind of a kind of circle like a stones and I walked into the middle and it's beautiful and there's not a cloud in the sky it's a pure blue Peruvian sky piercing Sun red nose to prove it and I stood there and what happened to me then happened to me I'm cover this bit in the new shop in ride where I'm standing there and suddenly I feel like my feet are being pulled to the ground and like in like magnetically and I'm feeling like a drill in the top of my head and the atmosphere changed again OD this was much more powerful than the news show and I heard this again very strong thought form go through my mind which said first of all they'll be talking about this a hundred years from now what and then which saint seemed absolutely crazy given the sky in the Sun and it will be over when you feel the rain right and then what happened is my arms went out like that without me making any decision to do to to do that and then this energy got more and more powerful and in the end my body's shaking and and what what's happening it's like when you drive in a car and you can't remember the last mile your subconscious has been driving the car thank goodness I kept coming back to some kind of consciousness and then going back somewhere else and as I came back to consciousness at one point my conscious mind I noticed that over the far distant mountains there was a light gray mist and I'm watching it and it's getting dark and it's getting darker faster and I think it's frickin raining and then over not very long the whole thing took maybe I don't know an hour 45 minutes an hour this storm came out of the I mean you couldn't make it up if you put if you put this on it on a movie they'd say oh come on it happened this this storm is coming towards me and you know whether people talk about a front yeah well this is a front it's a straight bloody line I'm looking up it's it's it's literally out with some crazy movie and this and it's stair rod rain it's not just raining it's steroid rain and it's coming towards me and I'm standing there and I'm seeing this wall of water coming towards me it's like something out of bloody Moses Brecon Red Sea and and and by this time and the body's shaking like crazy with this energy coming through me and then the water hit me I mean I mean it mediately drenched because it's stair ron rain and bang the energy stopped and I staggered forward like Bambi because my legs were gone and there were energy pouring out me feet and pouring out me hands and it's still pouring out there me feet I couldn't sleep that night because of it and something changed i if you people could imagine you lived your life in a bubble literally a bubble of information a bubble of perception and someone's come along without any warning and pop the bloody thing and suddenly everything that was outside the bubble was pouring in so my mind is absolutely awash with information concepts insights what the hell was going on that it was just a chaotic massive of information and thought and everything and in that period it lasted about three months if you'd have asked me my name and I checked and that it was in that period in me turquoise shell suit that I went on to the the Wogan show and and everything that that that that happened and after about three months after all the ridicule and all the newspapers and all that stuff basically you know when you you you press too many keys on a computer in the computer freezes says I can't process this well that was me there was so much information pouring into my conscious mind as a result of that experience in Peru I could process it you basically froze what happened after three months is it unfroze and now I'm the old David again but I ain't just more I'm seeing the world in completely different way I'm see I'm as they as they say when you read a newspaper the truth is in the white bits not the words the bits in between you know you and so I was seeing things and connections that I couldn't see before did you have a question yourself they'll David I think am I losing my mind Danny to go and get help or the discrete Fourier that well understand that about more well it felt right to me I would say I completely understood it then it felt right to me and and I IIIi did I did what I always do like I've just mentioned earlier I thought okay I'm going with this and we're gonna see where it's gonna go and I didn't know where he was going but I'm gonna go with this and see where it goes and people were coming up to me after that you know Shh unfreezing and they were saying it thought they thought you'd got mad you're the same Dave we used to know but I wasn't I appeared to be but I wasn't I was seeing the world in a completely different way and of course in in a world which is overwhelmingly programmed to see the world in a certain way it's what happens through the education system and the media and peer pressure it's very very narrow band of sense of the possible sense of what is when you start talking about things that are different to that then immediately the reaction is you're crazy or you're dangerous or in my case you're both but what followed what followed of course was mass ridicule as a report the Wogan show and people said you know it must have been horrible what it was but it was the greatest gift I ever have been given because it set me free of the prison that most people live in which is the fear of what other people think when you literally can't walk down the street without being laughed at I mean I lived my life for a long time after that to the sound of distant or even close laughter going into a pub forget it and so you either go under and you disappear but majority people do yeah or you come out like steel honed in the fire and you let go of this this this prison this ball and chain that most of the population of the world live in the fear of what other people think most people the vast majority of people because of this fear are not living their truth they're not living their life they're not living their uniqueness they're living what they think is acceptable to other peoples of what they should be so they they go through mental gymnastics before saying things even more today with political correctness and all this bollocks what can I say so they won't say I'm this or that or or what can I say and how can I say it so they won't think I'm mad now when the world appears it wasn't the world there were others that saw through it but certainly appeared to be the world and was the vast majority or ridiculing you mercilessly I mean someone only had to say my name in in a in a comedy thing I'm in with David Frost just mentioned my name in a raw Variety Performance the bloody audience laugh did you know joke necessary how did that affect you in your family did you ever think that moving up here did you find yourself I can't handle us will you ever so saved or what anything David no absolutely all right no I'm a I'm a stubborn bugger me and and the more the more you tell me what I can't say the more I'll say it the more tell me what I can't do I'll do it and uh but there was there was something obviously you've got confusion what the hell is happening to me what's happening but there's a there was a core beyond that that somehow just knew this was going to be okay and it was leading somewhere and just some knowing that you can't really explain and I get I tell you a story a true story I'm sitting on I'm sitting in the seat on the wagon show and he's talking to me and the audience are laughing and and David Icke they experience her experience rather not the experience sir the experience was was dying but something something beyond that was saying to me as it was happening this is leading somewhere it's gonna be okay it's gonna be fine it's gonna okay be okay and that doubt that that wherever that was coming from that kind of kept me going through all this period of ridicule and you know I didn't know at that point of course some of the things that I was going to be taught about I didn't know what was coming and what was gonna be uncovering and all that stuff so many things on that sure David yeah yeah yeah covered because you went back on their walking sure wish you'd done apologize for it came true yeah so many stuff so again that's showing that you stood up for what you believe done it that come to what do you think David as humans who are we as individuals who are these people wild winless planet do you think well let's put this planet into and this experience into context which is something you almost never hear we have unbelievable numbers of television channels radio channels now 24/7 beaming out all over the world all the time how often comparatively do you see programs about the nature of reality actually actually who are we what is this place what we doing here surely that would be at the center of questioning but it's not it's marginalized because if you have a population that is living a reality which actually doesn't exist but they experience it as if it does you've already put them in a cul-de-sac of perception and that's where you want them if a few are going to control the many you can't have an enlightened population you've got to have an ignorant population that believes in things that aren't real and that's why you hit so many lies pour out of politics because they're trying to get the population to believe something that's not true but this is a much deeper level of it let's get them to believe in a reality that's not true while the very few not the politicians are overwhelmingly the ignorant is anyone else if not more so but at the core in the shadows they understand how reality works and they want the population not to know that's why you don't have this who are we where are we how does all this work discussed in it in any length or even at all mostly in the media but let's put this into perspective if I said to most people if you look into this room can you see everything in the room everything in the space that you're looking at there go oh yeah of course again no Yukon 450 mansions yeah um according to mainstream science the electromagnetic spectrum which is basically the reality we live in um is naught point naught nor 5% of what exists in the universe and the universe is only one construct within infinity and visible light which is the only frequency band that we can see everything we see visually is within this band visible light is a smear of the naught point naught naught 5% some say it's a bit more as much as naught point five percent but negligible whatever and therefore what we're not actually living in a world we're living in a band of frequency tiny which contains an informational field or fields and we are interacting with those informational fields just like a computer interacts with Wi-Fi and we are decoding those informational fields into what appears to be and we experience as a solid whoa oh there you go yeah so human beings who do you think for us here are weak are we the aliens are we computers are we what is the question I should be asking here because as I think about it all the time who the [ __ ] are we who am i what am I here for and are we are we come from apes are we fish are we so many questions you can ask that what's true what's real was big we don't come from apes that's another kind of because ours Apes though here the fuel yes but you know when you follow that story back it's it's a nonsense but it's a great diversion from what's actually going on because are we computers at the level of consciousness no see if you said to me who are you I would say I am awareness I am a state of being aware forget the body forget everything in my base form I am a a state of awareness I am a point of attention within an infinite stream of awareness and you are a point of attention in the same street and of awareness and so's everybody else but your point of attention which is influenced by your life experience sees the world in a certain way and my point of attention sees it in a certain way but we're all together points of attention within the same stream of consciousness this is what makes racism and sexism and all these isms utterly nonsensical unfortunately if you want to find racists then go and find anti-racists because anti-racists are obsessed with what race they see race everywhere in other words we're back to the labels they see labels everywhere you are a that race label you are at that race label no doesn't matter if you're black white or sky-blue pink they're just vehicles for experience transitory experiences and do you think we are we are Muslim or black or white or Hindu when we leave the body of course not that that's that these are these are belief systems within this tiny band of frequency we call the world and because we self-identify with them instead of just enjoying them you know I like being a Muslim I like being a white guy I like being a black guy okay fine it's an experience enjoy but don't think it's you because once you think that your labels are you bang and so what I what that what transformed my life is when I started to understand this and I started to self-identify not with David Icke as Who I am but as what I'm experiencing but what I am is consciousness having the experience that's what's leaving the body at what we call a near-death experience when people leave the body they've got no eyes but they can still see they've got no brain but they can still think it's because um they are consciousness and consciousness as the ability to to hear think everything but the body what the body does you think of consciousness consciousness does not if you like vibrate it's not within the frequency band of this reality we're experiencing so it's like radio one radio two radio three or four are all sharing the same space but they don't interfere with each other why cuz because they're not on the same frequency so consciousness is not on in the range of frequency that we are directly experiencing in what we call the physical world so to experience these this band of frequency this reality the our consciousness takes on and it what we call an external form which is operating within the frequency band of this world and because of that I can pick that glass up my consciousness could not pick that glass up because it's on a completely different frequency to the glass but but operating through this this outer shell what I call a biological computer and it can pick the glass up because there are compatible frequencies of you think sort of David do you think those other species on this planet because you spoke about that very few quite a lot you've law what whereabouts do you think those other people walking among those as well absolutely I mean let's put this again into into context according to mainstream science if you compare the size of planet Earth with the size of the projected size of the universe planet Earth is the equivalent of a billionth of a pinhead so if you say that life as we know it only exists on a billionth of a pinhead within the greater reality you are well yeah yeah well that's credible you you could be an academic saying that but you say actually hold on a minute elephant living room sofa billionth of a pinhead night sky which is a tiny fraction even of one galaxy and there's billions of galaxies in the universe they say now despite all that life is Mike but we're saying that life as we know it only exists on a billionth of a pinhead and nowhere else I mean it's insanity and then you think this looking at the vastness of different forms that exists in animals in insects in in nature in all of it even in the human race look at someone from China or someone from Asia and some off to South America from South Africa from from from Europe look look at the differences you'd look at the range of form of different form and expressions of form that exist within a smear of naught point naught naught 5% of the universe what the heck in the infinity beyond this reality which is almost the entirety of everything what the heck exists out there in terms of form but and different expressions of conscious hope does in all ways out David see I'm a man who questions everything unless I see more knives I struggle to believer and people say oh I don't believe in conspiracy if you use a me touched on earlier I believe in science but is it because unless you see it with your own eyes that everything is aware you perceive things are your perception how do you actually know what's out there how do we know we're not on a snow globe boat up in all the worlds not flower around hope they're in all the answers what basically you don't in terms of you know every I dotted and every T crossed all you can do is put the information that you together and come to conclusions that's that's all you can you can really do but you know when I'm talking about non-human non-human races interacting with and manipulating human society I've not sat in a darkened room and pulled it out the bloody eath smoking a weed ii-i've been to more than 60 countries over 30 years researching this I've talked to whistleblowers on the inside of the American military and intelligence complex many of them I've talked to shamans around the world who are carriers of the ancient knowledge of those societies and when you put what the to say together you you you get the same answer that yes there is a nonhuman force that is manipulating human society and and you see it in ancient accounts you see the common themes around the world in different cultures describing the same thing and you see one common theme for instance which is that this non-human force manipulated human genetics this comes out in the Old Testament for instance as the sons of God who interbred with the daughters of men people say oh that's a that's if that's that's in the Bible yes it is but but the theme is everywhere in non Bible countries galore a cultures galore and and so you put it all together and then you come to conclusions then you write it down you connect the dots and then you put it out and then people decide whether they want to believe it or not that's that's the that that's the deal but you know when you look at how narrow the band is that we can see and perceive I don't I might my my experience over the last thirty years says to me that's not an accident mm-hmm somehow human genetics has been manipulated to only perceive a very narrow band of reality which makes us obviously far more controllable and you talk you always talk about being controlled or talking about you spoke about it years ago David about kids getting microchipped and now we're getting Michael checked where they can follow us about and the Illuminati can you touch on that the people who a small percentage of the people who control the world well one of the things that you know it's a head shaker to me and I smile to myself these days is over the years people have told me Authority has told me authorities trying to tell me even more now but I'm wrong and because I'm wrong I can't say what I'm saying and right what I'm writing and then they prove me bloody right you know I I said I said back in the back in the 90s when I was producing the first books that there was a plan for the world and that plan included the destruction of freedom of speech and the creation of a centrally controlled global fascist communist noxus whatever you want to call it state they're all different terms for the same tyranny that this included microchipping the population don't even start me on that is way way way along the line already and that money would be taken out circulation so only cashless money would digital money would be used which has fundamental implications for freedom and control and a stream of other things which have all come true and the reason I could do that is very simple how did oldest Huxley in 1932 in his book brave new world how was he able to describe genetic drug and other things that in a dystopian way that is now happening how could George Orwell be so accurate in 1948 what about the other people that I quote in my books insiders way back who were saying this is what's going to happen cuz this is the plan and it's all happening in detail not even theme detail because there is a plan there is a script and what I've done for the last 30 years is work to uncover what that is and once you do which you know what's plan and predicting the future is is quite straightforward that's why so many you know I I see my books from the 1990s read on the TV news everyday now in changes in society it's because I have this phrase know the outcome and you'll see the journey if you don't know what the outcome is planned to be then what happens in the world in world events and daily happenings appear to be random they seem to have no pattern they seem no I have no rhyme and reason they just happen or there you blame them on something else when you know what the outcome is planned to be which is what I've been in covering all these years then you start to see that these apparently random events are not random at all they are stepping stones towards the outcome you talk about we talk about freedom of speech freedom of speech is being systematically destroyed and I'll give you the outcome on that the outcome desired outcome is that there comes a point which we're moving towards so fast when no one will ever see or hear anything that is not acceptable to the authorities to the system and we are seeing now daily freedom of speech and censorship being increased and increased and increased towards that desired outcome of deleting all information that the authorities don't want people to see now what's been happening the internet was actually created by this cabal but we can talk about that if you like about you know why that was and where where it's going but one of the reasons is that they wanted to put all information eventually that people receive and where they get their information thus their perceptions which come from information received that's what perceptions are from the internet digitally and the reason they want to do that is because once it's digital then you can use algorithms to censor you don't even need human input once the codes are in place the algorithms as they're doing now censor what people can see in here now what is freedom of speech it's the freedom to speak and if you have the freedom to speak then you have the ability to challenge the prevailing narrative and thus you're never in a situation where people only see in here what the authorities want you can see in here for that to be reached that situation free speech has to be deleted otherwise they're not going to get there that's why free speech is being deleted and George Orwell had this this concept of freedom in effect being the ability to say that two and two equals four because while you can you have the right to say two and two equals four you have the right to freedom of speech you have the right to speak factually and not be censored even though you're speaking fact but error wrong facts from the authorities point of view and in 1984 in the book society moved to a point where they they were told they had to believe that two and two equaled five and you couldn't say totally good for anymore you had to believe that two inch we were called five because that's what the authority wanted you to believe so they got the outcome that they wanted and what happens is that initially and we're in that point now when you're being pressured to believe two and two equals five and to say it and not contradict it there is a resistance which says why it's a load of bloody nonsense turnt orders even equal five but when you then start giving people consequences for not accepting to a jerkles five abuse losing your job all the rest of it marginalization people then start in search of self-respect they don't want to they don't want to accept that what they're doing is being cowed into saying two and two across five when they know it's fall so they start to convince themselves two and two equals five so it becomes not they're in for reality eventually it becomes their perceived reality and some but suddenly the world's gone frickin mad and that is absolutely the process that's happening now what level of madness may have we reached when professors of biology are being investigated by their universities and abused by students for saying that men and women are biologically different men and women are biologically different okay men are women are biologically different another way of putting it two and two equals four but the so-called progressive they're not at all the fascist thick Marxist whichever term you want to use progressive narcissistic stormtroopers of political correctness Twitter stormtroopers are insisting that you believe two and two equals five and it's a very simple thing if you want something to happen which if you had an open debate you couldn't win it and therefore it couldn't happen you simply don't have the debate and you know I have a phrase if you want to know and see that the foundation elements of this agenda of human mass control look at the subjects you cannot have another opinion about look at the subjects where if you have a different opinion to the official narrative you're going to get abuse ridicule and other consequences that's the agenda shutting up simply simply for this reason if you can't win a debate on facts and of course men and women are not biologically different is not a debate you can win on facts then you don't have the debate you shout down abuse people who have that and we're talking beforehand I posted something on my website today which I saw this morning where there's a there's a meeting at a university in America and there's speakers they're a woman stand I should stand up she's sitting down but a woman's spoke one of the speakers who was kind of a an academic in her field and she said what it's obviously that there are biological differences between men and women because if you look at the facts fa cts I think that spell people will forget that soon then the vast majority of men are taller than women women have different fat in different places they have different muscular types people in the audience started walking out she's just saying the bloody obvious and they're walking out why she's saying two and two equals four they believe two and two equals five and I insist everyone else does cameraman follows them out and they're out in the lobby saying that's Fassett that's fascist we can't sit and listen to that fascism what that men and women are biologically different this is where we are going and this is why it's so important that people are not intimidated into silence because I meet so many people who say yes alone and nonsense but you know what look what happens if you say so and and you know one of my roles if you like is a being the kid pointing at the naked Emperor while everyone's sycophant eclis hovering around saying wonderful new clothes Emperor oh what a lovely jacket and I'm saying hold on it the guy's freaking naked closer what are you talking about and that of course is two and two equals four thank you pot roast you'll notice because they are and it's systemic it's being done systematically condition report to to shopping but what is political correctness I'll keep it in a line it's manipulating the target population to silence itself that's what it is in false flag events David you've you've blue device worn a couple of them what as a false flag event yeah event for people who don't know well one of the things that I one of the phrases I came up it has now become into quite common parlance in the alternative media anyway I came up with it in the 1990s was problem reaction solution this is so important there's there's two mass manipulation techniques because this is the bottom line this conspiracy is a conspiracy to psychologically program the population why do people behave the way they do why does someone behave that way and someone behave that way perception that person's perception leads them to behave that way this person perception leads them to to behave this way and where does perception come from information received people process information received and they reach their perception so if you can control information received you control perception you control behavior this is what happens when you control information and if you control it totally which is where they're going this I've just talked about then you eventually control behavior totally because you're controlling all perception what problem reaction solution and it's stablemate what I call the totalitarian tiptoe our our psychological manipulation techniques and they used on us all the time problem reaction solution other people call it false flag you want to change the world in a certain way and you know that if you stand up and openly say this is what we're gonna do you're gonna get a big resistance against it people are gonna say we're not having that what's going on when what are you doing that for there's no reason so what you do is you give them a reason stage one you create a problem could be a terrorist attack it could be a financial collapse it could be a government collapse it could be whatever you then tell the population via an unquestioning and pathetic mainstream media the version of that problem you want them to believe you name the villain you name the reason for why that problem is happening when you in the shadows have actually made it happen at stage two a problem reaction solution you want a reaction from the public of outrage of fear of whatever the reaction is required and then you want them to in effect say do something something must be done and then those who've created the problem covertly and blamed someone else and got you to believe it then offer the solutions to the problems they've created and they are solutions that push on this agenda for the world more and more control more and more centralization of power more and more dictatorship um and they they can make that happen with the solution to a manufactured problem that they couldn't have done without the problem and so how much freedom has been taken away because of terrorist attacks well what if what if not everyone but what if many of those terrorist attacks were actually not what they appear to be but were actually orchestrated by the very system that wants to change society and you know this create the problem offer the solution is happening all the time and that links in with something else I've mentioned the totalitarian tiptoe you're at a and you want to take the world to Z you know if you go in to bigger leap towards ed the change is going to be so dramatic that people are going to look up from the game show or the sport and say what's happening so you go as far as you can as fast as you can but not so far you alert too many people to the fact that there's a pattern here and so you have a problem reaction solution and you take a step deleting freedom do more surveillance more control then you have another problem reaction solution and you do it more and you do it more and you do it more if you look at the European Union it's a classic totalitarian tiptoe we were told we were joining a a free-trade area called the common market good for jobs okay that's where it starts but they were that's not where it was planned to finish that was just the foot in the door and then you have more and more centralization of power well if we centralized power it would be more efficient you know over this and over that and over that and well that start and then it goes on and on and on until we've reached the point now where Europe is controlled in fine detail by a handful of bureaucrats that the vast majority of people in Europe couldn't even name and and I had to smile the other the other the other month in my books in the 1990s I said the plan is for a European army and EU army our load of rubbish we've got NATO ridiculous now last few months Merkel and in Germany and macron in France who were just puppets of this whole thing like May and and Trump and all of them they've come out and said we've had an idea we've had an idea we should have a European army what do you mean you've had an idea how did I know about it in 1993 how much stuff if you said David that's came through does it scared you the stuff at the house came through and go I [ __ ] told you so did you set by and go tour geez no I don't what well what what I what I do is I point out when things happen that I said them but I don't I'm way back but I don't say see told you so I do it for a reason and this reason if I knew about it 20 30 years ago it's not random is it it's not just happening it's planned otherwise I couldn't have known it how could all I've known it how could Huxley have known it and these other people that I quote how could they have known it how could someone I quote in in the books a rockefeller big-time rockefeller insider have described the internet that was coming in 1969 how could he have done that how could he have said in 1969 we are gonna make boys and girls the same how would he have known that because there's a plan and it's projected much further ahead than people think the real answers people control them what old maybe are a hundred years ahead 200 years yeah because it's another big story once you would you go off into another force that's not human their timeline and their projections are not the same that we live in where we you know if you're going down a river on a canoe you see as far as the next turn in the river but what if there's a force that can see the whole the whole river all the from start to finish then they have a completely different timeline in a different ability to project the future how did George Orwell know about Smart TVs Smart TVs and we're only seeing mark one two three at the moment not where they plan to go they have cameras in them and microphones in them that film you ain't confirmed we're in your front room and record your conversations in your front room well admits about was it submitted you know somebody found them and then they had to admit that it was true in 1984 which came out in 1948 George Orwell was talking about in in the 1984 Society that there were telly screens in every home and the telescreens were constantly filming you but big brother's watching these brothers watching so because it's a projected projected long into the future if you can access that either of course you're an insider or you know thirty years of bloody research full time then you can you can predict the future because the simple thing is if nothing intervenes to stop that process unfolding that will happen so you can predict the future the whole point of what I do is to alert enough people eventually to all these things that there is an intervention and it is stopped because of few people and it is a few in full knowledge in the shadows cannot manipulate and direct the lives of seven point seven billion because they don't have the numbers to do it they have to manipulate the perceptions of the population which becomes the behavior of the population thus the population behaves in a way that the few can control the many and the key factor above all other factors is to keep that target population in complete ignorance of what you're doing and so the more that you can uncover it and communicate it and people become aware that this is happening and thus events in the world are happening because of this are not randomly the more chance there is of an intervention and the population saying we're not having it the people you've spoke out against ever the most powerful people in the world the other get scared that they'll take over your life that the pineal they'll try and shut you up because I've tried so many times to shut you up there's no banned you from us through yeah yeah you ever feel that I'm endangered here have you ever felt your life in danger from the high up pebbles and the people who control the world never crosses my mind no I mean that might be hard for people to believe but it's true it never crosses my mind and and for this reason a we're more powerful when we take our power back than ever we believe we are and you know I look on these people as pathetic little boys in short trousers little boys and girls in short trousers because what kind of psychopathic insanity does it take to want to impose your will over a vast population of people I mean it's pathetic they are pathetic I'm gonna be frightened of them are you having a laugh no way and this is the other point is this once you start self identifying with being consciousness that's my eternal state your external tape at state everyone's eternal state consciousness a state of awareness well whether it's in this body or be out of this body eventually anyway at some point whether it's in this body or not in this bodies is almost irrelevant because it's always the state of consciousness having an experience of some kind so the worst that can happen to me is that I leave this body right and I will eventually anyway going to stay here forever my god but you can have too much of a good thing so it never crosses my mind if you're taken out you taken out but you're taken out trying to do the right thing and it takes courage well do you think no David well courage courage is overcoming fear which is a really powerful thing courage overcoming fear when you let go of fear you don't need courage you just do it it's not like you know if I said I've just written a book finished it it's gonna be probably the most controversial book certainly given current times probably going to be one of the most controversial books ever written and and so I know what's coming with it but I don't fear it used to I don't fear it because I'm putting out what I believe to be right and I don't need courage to put it out cuz I don't fear putting it out because don't fear the reaction the reaction is what it is so you react yeah and a lot of people abroad people are going to read it and go thank God someone's saying it at last and the system's gonna say ban him condemn him couldn't you think that doing the same thing which I'm carry know that but they dead per few years ago tried to kill them and call them crazy and say oh they're bad shot towards them because he's came to hurt us but it's all weakling he wants to stay away from the media and dude he's under words and just try to heal himself and get away from the fold shut there was involved them for so long well I I spent an evening with Jim Carrey actually read it home with my son Jamie some years ago when I was in LA and we had a very interesting chat and again Jim Carrey's had a experience similar to me where we're basically the bubble popped and the Whale lifted and it can be a challenging time because suddenly you're perceiving another reality that's so different to the one you've been perceiving before and of course when you start talking about it for reasons we've discussed you're going to get ridiculed for it by the mainstream the trick is not to care and from what I've seen of Jim you don't care and you know you know people just thought look oh look at this the range of things you perceive is that really the limit of what there is to perceive is that really the limit of what there is to know is that the limit of ways of seeing the subjects you have views about well of course not it's a tiny tiny tiny fraction anybody's views are a tiny fraction of possibility so why aren't we exploring all possibility not that you you you come across information and just because you come across it all that's true then I'll believe that now no you question it you you process it you come to conclusions about it but it's very simple and history shows us this systematically reducing the amount of information views and diversity of information and views available to people never ends up well it never turns out good it always turns out bad for Humanity because you look at any tyranny fascist tyranny communist tyranny whatever it is whenever they get power they want to destroy all alternative information and view the challenges what they want people to believe every time so whenever you're in a situation where the free flow of information and view and opinion is being censored you are in a tyranny and what humanity has allowed itself not everybody of course but great numbers especially the political correctness group is is they've allowed themselves to become a tyranny while claiming to be anti tyranny I see anti-fascist protests full of people acting for cystic lis because they're so far up their own arse and so full of their own self purity they don't realize that what they're doing is actually projecting their own behavior in what their opposing anyone who gives someone a hard time for having a different view however much they may not agree with it is a psychological fascist in my view because they are seeking to impose their will on someone else and it's quite simple you let all information be circulated and then people make their own minds up what they want to believe on what they don't believe and this is a key what we're seeing now not least through algorithms and and through self-censorship by being intimidated into into being terrified of speaking your truth we're seeing information censored before the point of delivery before anyone can hear it this is fundamental because I believe that all information and all views should be allowed to be expressed because if anyone is censored from expressing those beliefs then no one has freedom of speech freedom of speech is freedom of speech the freedom to speak it's not freedom to speak what is acceptable it's the freedom to speak and once anyone is censored freedom of speech is dead because what's left is only what is acceptable to speak and that's not freedom of speech and then what they've done and what they're doing all the time he's squeezing that acceptability so freedom of speech gets narrower and narrower until it disappears altogether and so what we have is a situation where if people are allowed to say and communicate whatever they want that is a situation where no authority in any form has the power to decide what people see in here once you start censoring before the point of delivery which as I say algorithms and self-censorship is now doing you are giving authority the power to decide what people see in here and of course it starts out with one excuse we must stop jihad is you know justifying or promoting violence okay Oh fake news fake news what's fake news whatever we say it is yeah we've got to stop people saying fake news so we're gonna censor that oh the more people we can get to be victims and upset the more excuses we've got to censor even more right yeah so give people all the excuses they want to be upset and to be feel a victim then then we can censor people saying things that upset them and so you're moving along this road none of that can happen when we have the free flow of information nothing censored so people say well what about you know saying go and kill people yeah but there's loss against that there's noise against that there's loss against telling people or burn that house down but they're after the point of delivery which means you can deal with the extremes of what our people use speech but it's it's heard but then you can deal with it if it needs dealing with it most speech does not need dealing with it all you know come on let's go and kill this person well obviously you know you deal with that you have to deal with that but it's after the point of delivery and as long as we hold that line authority has no power to censor what we're seeing now is the opposite of that that be up before that line is where most censorship is starting to happen and thus freedom is disappear do you think the burgers cover up or not planet as David for your perspective oh I think the biggest cover-up is the conspiracy and totality because you know people say to me sometimes you seem to see conspiracies everywhere I don't see one conspiracy with multiple faces and multiple facets but not the same as seeing conspiracies everywhere and it's simply this that there is a cabal that wants to create a situation which I've been saying since the 1990s and early 1990s and look at it now where we have a world government a world central bank the world government dictating to every community on earth a world central bank dictating all finance a world single digital currency which means that through algorithms and even you know human input you can wipe someone's bank account away because there's no cash in that society you think you got money there you go you can do it you can do it um very simply it's control you go into a shop now and you end over a credit card electronic money and they say sorry what's except your card you can still pay cash when there's no cash and they say well except your card or your microchip as it's meant to be eventually then whoever controls the computer controls if you have the ability to purchase anything so that's all about control they want a world army to impose the will of the world government and that is mcc's Panchal expansion of NATO this European army is all part of that that they're proposing and they want a microchipped population connected to a global computer system actually what what is what is known as the smart grid you know this technological society is a Trojan horse of monumental proportions and if people remember nothing they should remember this they're now openly talking people like Ray Kurzweil at the Google executive you know Google Facebook all these organizations Amazon they're all controlled by the same force to the same end that's why they're becoming monopolies we're dictating to people what they can see in here and all that stuff it's all planned but what Ray Kurzweil is talking about now and people like him is that by around the year 2030 humanity will be have their brains connected to artificial intelligence and he's very open about it as this goes on artificial intelligence will do more and more of human thinking until human thinking as we know it now is basically negligible in other words you'll be a computer terminal and someone else's internet and the reason they're being so open about it is there is the sales pitch which is you'll be superhuman if you do this and what you'll be is subhuman and human consciousness human thought human emotion as we've known it will be over because every thought every emotional response will come from AI he who controls AI will then control every humans perceptions directly who is connected to AI and we've been taken along a very clear process to take us to that point Stage one see I'm coming up 67 and I'm glad I was born when I have doing what I'm doing now because I have a radar I can remember what the world was like before people born into it you see when you get born into the world the world appear you you think the world is how it is because you're born into it this is how it is okay but it's not how it always was when you're born into the world as it is you don't really have so much of a compass to to get a fix on the world as it is because it's just how it is when you were born before it is as it is now you have a compass you have a comparison you can see the scale the stunning scale of the change not least since this technological society kicked in and and then went kind of on steroids stage one you get the population addicted to technology they can hold but basically achieved smartphones tablets except and you target especially the young why cuz they're gonna be the adults at the point you want to bring in this full-blown ai-controlled human you want them so addicted and obsessed with technology that as happens now on one expression of it they'll get up in the middle of the night and go and cue in the dark outside an apple bloody store to get the first version of the new thing get them addicted enough and they'll queue up waiting to be connected to AI right so that's why they're targeting the young stage true because what you want to do you want to get in the body and if they went directly to the body but anything in between people go what's going on totalitarian tiptoe you see so the next stage is on the body what they call wearables holder balls - wearables this is your your Apple watch and your Bluetooth and all these gadgets now that people where they're connected to the Internet and then you go to the next stage which is in the body I spoke there while ago last year in Sweden and people thousands of people now in Sweden have be microchipped and and queuing up for it having parties to celebrate microchips and and this is what happens with addiction um it's called addiction for a reason you were addicted and so this is this has been the process that is taking us along here kitty kitty kitty here kitty kitty kitty along this road to the point where they want to introduce fully-blown ai-controlled humans this is where it's going and it's within the lifetime well within the lifetime of people alive today even those that aren't young it's within their lifetimes - and and and all these diversions look here look here smell this look at this here this are all to stop us going deep breath take a step back look at it again shite look what they're doing and that's what I'm doing you know I'm pointing this out I'm saying over here see sofa elephant elephant not giraffe elephant but there it is before we funny shot David and what I thought Sean ho ho true as the heart the way that control Hojo's not 100% yeah what is whether its energy there in it what is the whether its electromagnetic information fields or something over there that controls the weather the heart was it such them that are perfect well HAARP in Alaska is is one of them they're called ionosphere heaters but there's many of them now and they are high-powered radiofrequency technology that manipulates the electromagnetic field of the planet and within that electromagnetic field is are the fields of energy that we call weather so if you can manipulate those fields to act in different ways you can manipulate the weather you can create hurricanes you can create tornados you know what a tornado is it's a fast rotating electromagnetic field that's all it is that's why they appear during electrical storms it's electromagnetic fields spinning and you can spin electromagnetic fields and create tornadoes you can manipulate the field so that rain doesn't manifest you can create a drought or you can you can make rain manifest massively and you can you can get floods this is this is this is what you can do in fact I'll give you a very quick example going way back to what was it the 50s 50s I think it was 60s 50s something it was there was a rainstorm in place called Lynn meth in Devon that was so fantastic in such a short time that the river that comes down actually the stream not really a river down through the town into the sea was a vast wall of water that killed a great number of people I think it was not it was 1952 keeps coming to mind destroyed so many houses devastated the place and it was 250 times the rainfall that would be expected in that area right all these years later decades and decades later the BBC radio to be fair they don't do many good investigations then this was one they did an investigation program that established that the RAF had flown over that area just before and they'd sent out chemicals into the clouds that stimulated rain it was an experiment just came true well that's chemtrails which are of course they come out the back of planes and not contrails because they disappear because they're based on condensation and heat chemtrails come out of the plane and don't disappear they just pan out and eventually fall to earth were they're full of lots of things and and yes they are indirectly affecting the effect in the weather affecting many other things I my last book was called everything you need to know and have never been but I've never been told and it goes into some of this in detail that we're talking about now and all the other stuff we talked about but manipulating the weather is is is is very straightforward these days through technology but remember I said they manipulate the weather by manipulating electromagnetic fields that dictate the weather the body the brain is an expression of electromagnetic fields and electrical circuits technologically generated electromagnetic fields and electrical circuits Wi-Fi phone communications this lethal stuff they're bringing in now which is actually a weapon called 5g are fundamentally impacting upon the electromagnetic fields of the body which affect people psychologically and which affect them quote physically and emotionally it's why you get so many people who are close to these that suffer from depression it's because they're being affected by the electromagnetic technological electromagnetic impact on their their field which expresses itself psychologically interest emotion in terms of physicality and the body's electromagnetic fields and when they're in a balanced harmonious state equal physical health a lack of disease disharmony when you start impacting upon the hot the the balance of that field you create disharmony and through that you get physical dis which is just an expression of electromagnetic disharmony disease causes disease this is what this is why people that that work or live close to these sources of electromagnetic energy with a phone towers or poor or whatever are so they get cancers that are very rare in the population because they have certain effects that go on this is why radiation is dangerous this is why radiation affects you and of course what we're living in now almost everywhere is a a permanent state of of walking living and breathing through electromagnetic technologically generated fields your fingers are cure for everything David hey do you think was a cure for everything of course there is yeah if everything can go wrong in Gori everything can go right it's just finding out what can go right and if you are the mainstream medical profession which is basically just an extension of the pharmaceutical industry it's all it is then you are not given the full range of possibility to treat disease disharmony you're given the scalpel and the drug in other words you're given a bloody hammer and you're told that every human problem be it psychological emotional or physical is a fricking nail and so oh what have you got Oh OMG rest Oh over here bang there you go you get you you'll get that at the drugstore what do you think goes on you know this is what happened because of the medical profession he's just another expression of the postage stamp consensus as I call it this narrow band of information that people not only believe in but are forced in terms of the medical profession to believe in because you want to I know people doctors who've realized that alternative methods of healing are better than what they do the scalpel in the drug they've been struck off for using them even though it benefits the patient because the pharmaceutical industry controls the medical profession this is this is why now we're seeing this war on the circulation of information challenging the official story of vaccines and this is why YouTube is de monetizing and deleting same with Amazon and Facebook information that's challenging the official story of vaccines one of the reasons in the immigration minister's diatribe in Australia saying why my visa is going to be revoked four hours before we plane that for Australia and like months and months after I was given it was my views on vaccines so and my views on climate change caused by humans which it isn't climb it's always freakin changed but that means that in Australia in a society that believes it's free you the pharmaceutical industry that makes billions and billions of pounds out of vaccines can say what it likes about vaccines but me for me me one-bedroom flat on the Isle of I can't go to Australia and give a different view now we're back to something else why why are is the Australian government which which is an asset of the pharmaceutical industry like all of them why is it so terrified of me why a doctor called sherry Tenpenny from America who is a big Challenger of vaccinations she was also banned from Australia now so you've got the vastness of the pharmaceutical industry that can advertise its products and vaccines on the television but they're terrified of a handful of people going to Australia and challenging that you know why cuz they can't win the debate and they're so aware they can't win the debate they're so aware it's a scam certainly at the pharmaceutical level that they have to shut up everybody even the smallest voice doing giving another view and my band from Australia has was a big wake-up call for Australians I think the the petition to get me in you know closing in on 20,000 now because it reminded them and put in their face Australia may seem to be a free country but it's not Britain may seem to be a free country it's not neither's America that these are illusions and they're terrified of other opinions of course they know that what they're trying to one to sell the public across the range of subjects is a load of old bollocks that will not stand up to factual scrutiny where do people get your books David David Icke calm they'll get it within to get them within 24 hours there's a lot of them the the the newest one is everything you need to know the rent on the note it's out now it's been out for a little while and you won sorry we're talking about that I've just I'm literally just finishing that I think safety fella that will be out probably in about three or four months but I've also got a film coming out which I was asked if they could they will make a film of my life it's called renegade seen the trailer over there yeah and that is we've got some premieres of that in Manchester and London and Los Angeles and New York the dates are on the on the website davidduke.com and I'll be attending all of them and are taking questions afterwards and the the movie itself will be available to to download from June the 4th and and it's about my life yes but my life is the theme the backbone but it's packed with information exposing the the whole scam so I'm hoping it will bring in a lot of new people to see the world he's not actually like we thought it was yeah excellent David for coming on my show and government your team it's been excellent and your viewers your boots you stand on stage but then I was like a team and gave your views and your knowledge it you've got is there anything you'd like to finish up on and to try and follow any but then they just rock well it's maybe trying awaken ourselves now maybe going through the same Jonathan that you went felt years ago and they're scared with advice would you give them or what would you say to read them to amoeba VCS that could maybe help them well what what transformed my life and what would transform anybody's life is to reassess their self-identity stop self identifying with labels stop saying that's who I am no no that's what you're experiencing what you are is the awareness the eternal state of awareness that is having the experience and if you come from that point of view the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune and outrageous abuse and Twitter storms I like and but if you are dented by with the labels it becomes massive it becomes all-encompassing and I would say I would say this more than anything else and I'll say this to the kids okay the suicide of kids is just going through the frickin roof right in the social media era a lot of it if it is lack of self-respect coming from all the abuse and and all the impositions of what you should be and you're not good enough and you should be less and you're not remember that you are what you are and what you are now can be something else whenever you choose to become the totality of what you are instead of the little me that you think you are but if if you look at it the people who were abusing you who are ridiculing you who are telling you you're not good enough right well who the hell are they who are they who are they why do they matter I I can tell you from personal experience that people who abuse me years ago are now coming to my talks and reading my books because the thing the thing is that they'll think something else tomorrow that's for sure whatever they're saying now or they'll think something else tomorrow they'll say something else tomorrow but the point is the key point what the hell does it matter what they think about you what does it matter oh that person doesn't like it gives you a hard time well go find someone else then stop interacting with them go go go find some other people to interact with you know who are these people why are you allowing your life to be dictated by the opinions of other people you are unique no you're not like they are thank godoh most of the time so why are you worried about what they think why are you even worried if you get it down to two real basics what your parents think of you cuz you are what you are and you know for me the greatest gift you can give to your kids is to allow them to be what they are to allow them to go in the direction that they feel to go into instead of dictating to them the direction their life should take all you can't do that all you can't get that all what will the neighbors think I mean what will the neighbors think who cares no don't think what they like it doesn't matter and I'll tell you from experience it really doesn't matter what people say about you what people do about you what people think about you so long as you don't care it doesn't matter you didn't me you don't listen to people and say oh yeah I've got a point there maybe I'll look at that that's not the same thing it's it's being intimidated and being broken in spirit by what other people see you it doesn't matter it doesn't matter because anyone who's ever done anything in in the world look out all the way through history anyone who's made a real positive difference to the world is overwhelmingly faced ridicule and abuse before they were accepted to have been right all along majority get accepted after one day yeah exactly and if they had succumbed to fearing and responding to how people initially felt about them they would not have done what they did which was eventually accepted to be correct so when you're in a world a programmed world with such narrow programmed perceptions of reality if you stray beyond that you're gonna get laughed at you're gonna get ridiculed you're gonna get abused just so what it doesn't matter it only matters if you think it matters you know people abuse me thanks for sharing that with me have a nice day that's more a reflection on them though of course it is secure they lost its it's like we're talking earlier what I what I said you know every time we open our mouths we think we're making statements about other people we're not we make it a statements about ourselves every time we open our mouth and and people who go on social media and abuse other people behind the the the cowardice of login names is making a statement about themselves then they need to find themselves a mirror and maybe they have a chat with it and maybe they can realize that actually the statement is about them and not the people they're abusing their thing is not to care once you care about what other people think about you they have control of your life that'll be the frickin day yeah perfect David again met you've been absolute let's make a shot and for what you've achieved in the balls to keep carrying on and do what you do it take no problemo my cottage check out David's and stick around to our Facebook and YouTube channel don't meet your question I have a lot of stuff but again me it's been phenomenal and I wish all the best for the future the new book mmm it's been clear thank you thank you mate thank you brilliant ",3
SyHDrFcdJVo,"good people was good you guys listen to your favorite podcast connected to diets I got Kimmy cocoa to mom before I left yes little my man Riza thank you so much for coming on this guy's a legend yes I appreciate thank you for coming to Atlanta yes honor and a pleasure to have you here we reference some of your videos all the time really and if everyone knows the videos you've seen them they're all around social media you get 60 seconds of just pure jewels and knowledge and how he does it I don't know I present this something so good not true you know at the end of this show we do a recap and I try my best to punch everything in one day we appreciate that I wish it right now you have a book yes yes yes yes yes come on brother mess it up yeah that's definitely staying so yes with all that being said are you trying to have any connection to that as that book is so powerful when people read all the time we'll see message to the black man is the guide for the black man and woman in America to come out of the condition that we were put in by our treatment during slavery right we were removed from our language our name our culture our religion our original form of God our original way of practicing our culture so he reinstituted that by breaking down biblical scriptures showing how metaphorical and how literal they were Quranic scriptures historical facts data science etc other so he pretty much deprogrammed everybody with that book and reprogrammed us to understand exactly who we truly are by nature message to the Millennials is the 2019 version of that but in a modern form showing you how the United States government is coming after us specifically the black intellectuals who through something called the BIE system or black identity extremist in rights at FBI saying that those who are passionate about being black love being black love fighting game artists of a nation we think about find out damn please write okay we talked about that previous episode if you remember Jeff Sessions who was no longer the Attorney General yes he went on a rant and they asked on plenty of questions and during his during the session that they had at I think it was the house and they were questioning him as to what made these people black identity extremists and he had no idea how to explain that and it was basically anyone that was connected to at that time black lives matter yes or anybody that if so if you had the hashtag black lives matter for example on your page one so many times you really made yourself into a target yes so that specifically and I hear you talk about this before there's a reason why you why Millennials are that target ain't yes yes so and because the millennial generation first of all the generation deals with anyone born I believe from the late 1980s in June 2005 right so that deals with all of us is a really nice chunk it's like okay so when it comes to them targeting us by calling us bi es or black identity extremism what are they telling you that tell you one Cohen tell pro nd right that's one to not only is it not dead but we have a far more I would say wicked or conniving slice slick way of coming edge so they're gonna come at us through the colleges universities right they're gonna come out as a religion a bindi at that but they're gonna come at us through our jobs to our economic system through our food in our water through our clothing through our children's minds to tell lie vision mmm-hmm they're telling you lies so all of that so I'm gonna cover all this in the book but I'm also going to go into social media how it's been weaponized yeah the original purpose of that I'm going to go over food I'm gonna go over vaccinations I'm gonna go over the economic system all of these different things pretty much to break us out of the matrix give us a manual on how to navigate through it in modern time and how to bring us potentially away from this this eternal destruction of this country that they are trying to bring us into because they already know us collapsing can they put themselves but they trying to bring us down would exactly and adding gonna happen yeah oh my watch reason man last we will be talking about reparations and me as a black Kim and I remember Kim said I need like a new whip all this yeah yeah and my only fear is even if it does have a best-case scenario yes it happens do we even know what to do with the land how to eat to live and oh yes she brought that down yes but I don't think that we know how to actually eat to live when it comes to our clothing yeah comes to economics group economics yes entrepreneurs all these guys are all entrepreneurs but I don't think that we're taught these things so how can we learn from you and also from ourselves overall number one the Nation of Islam we actually have a farming for mainly for those in a nation and then they extended it to those who are not a nation for program on how to cultivate soil okay and particularly how to cultivate soil no chemicals whatsoever using certain earthworms secrete a chemical from their body that acts as a natural repellent that they use now something called roundup is when you but this is a natural form of that that doesn't kill the crops it doesn't harm human beings but it's from the secretion of earthworms and things of that nature but they were teaching that so how to cultivate soil how to plant per the seasons because it's supposed to be winter spring summer fall okay certain foods are available but hotter Hill is watermelon available you're ready see like certain things like not buy so we do have that program also for the majority of places in Atlanta Los Angeles all throughout the country they have farmers markets yes okay you should go visit your local farmers markets some of our Mexican are brown brothers they know what they don't yeah you can go talk to them this stuff is very simple we matter of fact a lot of the people don't even charge for the information you can just go and say can I spend an hour with you while you're doing your planting while you're doing all this so I can learn and I can jot down notes of report you're doing it yeah come on it is that self image that simple I mean this this stuff is not rocket science I'm putting all this in the book and I'm putting more videos out on it because we need to know about it now man right we need to know about it thirty years ago right to be real friends so yeah yeah so farmers markets I recommend also go to people who advocate for farming know to even certain people who own land but who don't know what to do with the land because then you can contract with them and say how about I pay you this much for this 13 acres or this one acre some colleges and universities own certain land would they have farming programs or they'll even sponsor plots of land 16 by 7 feet wide plots for you if you agree to use it right they do this we just need to know about Wow so how can we get your book it's at Reza Aslam calm our eyes easy a last name Islam like the religion is alien calm click pre-order message to the Millennials and make sure you read the description first so you know what you're getting yourself into because I'm going deep I'm not holding back matter of fact believe it or not I'll hold back a lot on social media I'm trying not to get shut down you know they can report it with certain things brother FBI been in my house three times brother they've already discussed things with me and I discuss things with them I'm not going to stop you can do what everyday you want to do yeah but this is 2019 I don't know how you think fear is something that I'd give a damn about yeah if I cared about that lotta hell do you think I'd be talking on your network every night let's just be real because weather is it comes with all the facts that interrupts fantasy last week because you know social media unless you create this world in its image and you can prompt you can find anything that you want to feed your fantasy but there are certain things that you actually need to know and I didn't really just once again have to tell you how much the world needs you and how much we've shown that on the way having that voice and somebody willing to put themselves out there for just the betterment of society I mean that's that's the destined literal definition of love to put your life on the star for your people and when you see somebody that's willing to do that you should definitely follow and support him I appreciate so everybody that's not follow him and if you are you already know he comes with the facts yes yes ma'am I appreciate that well so you we've seen you a lot lately we saw you at involved in a lot of going on and I see your tie oh yeah yeah I love it and that we say passing of Nipsey Hussle yes you were there on the front line yes and just tell us a little bit about the climate because you're from Compton oh yeah so for you I'm sure he meant a lot yes more than he he meant to some of us that were just you know fans of his music absolutel up more about like what he did for the community and what he meant and everything that's gone on since I could say this number one brother Nipsey Hussle was always true to himself he was true to the hood that he grew up in he was true to the people he was true to his family he was true to his culture being an African from Eritrea as well as a brother in the hood from LA he was true all the way around that's number one he never folded when it came to people asking him where he was from he was an active gang member but for the original purpose once he woke up alright so people and they turned it into shooting in order but no no no he brought it back to what it was originally for the commune for community resistance in progress as a true [ __ ] yeah the way schools educate them do it the right way you uplift in your community you are TrueCrypt if you stop your brother from killing your brother class he would true could you tell him to stand up to the police you were TrueCrypt right educating the children you putting them on you you know building businesses you buying land you putting the homeys on who got felonies cuz you know they can't get a job in the regular world you were true [ __ ] he was doing that embodied that and so we honor our brother we salute him because he was doing a lot of work he was building infrastructure he was investing in multiple companies I believe world on wheels he blown up in 50% of that he was and he was encouraging Bitcoin to be you I remember that oh yeah 2015 a small city in Amsterdam that ran completely on Bitcoin right no paper money right that is extremely now if anybody knows about this not assessment listen you are talking about America currently America will tell you that they are in debt a little over 27 trillion dollars that's bullcrap America's a little over 60 trillion in debt when you add in Medicare Medicaid all the bills and debts and sitter that they owe to families that they owe to other countries by the way the majority of countries that America talks about happens to be countries that they owe money to says that's why they talk about them because they can't give a money but they can bully them with the right okay Nipsey was encouraging Bitcoin because of that Bitcoin isn't regulated it's not only by the US government and because of that you literally can spend it everywhere who and so he was encouraging the hood to take on Bitcoin because he wanted to raise his hood to start there in the 60s and have that running on all Bitcoin which is why he encouraged I believe he invested in one of the schools there to give a stem a stem program with science in second yes vector 90 and he was encouraging the children to learn about science technology Bitcoin etc he was going to create a small he was creating a small revolution in it was like okay this [ __ ] smart he got a beard not any talking about I don't work for no white crackers in this song dedication on your masters on your publishing like this [ __ ] is too damn smart I mean I'm getting chills yeah brother he is so into he was connected yeah and he was a proud in a tree in brother from Africa he was a proud brother from the hood he was a proud honest 16 he was a proud father figure father in a big home he was a proud husband I mean the brother was he was all of that so what it meant to us those of us who grew up in the Crypt neighborhood and blood neighborhoods those of us who grew up in impoverished neighborhoods and who can see a brother in this day and age get the bag leave the hood get the bag and come back to the hood you came back and you use the money that you got to build up the hood that is damn near unheard of to most people in this day and age got it you you have to give honor where it is dude right it is far more than just this brother he's a rapper no he was not just a rapper he was a revolutionary got understand man so admit more to me being a brother from the hood who left my hood when it's a Hollywood and was acting been traveling the world doing all this stuff helping people for years but I'm always back I'm I said I still live in Compton I'm over from Compton I buy probably somewhere else but it's like now why are you gonna leave the hood you think you think what's happening here it's not gonna happen somewhere else exactly I can't escape racism right nowhere on this planet I've been across brah been to China what he loves a China yeah yeah but it's like you can't escape this so you need to go back to what made you as hard as you are and help me heal people there bring them up put them on so that we can change our own condition cuz ain't nobody else gonna do it for us right it's just that simple Sanaa man he meant a lot more the climbing was beautiful there wasn't one gang war Wow since he passed there has not been no major gang war that whole week and a half two weeks when everybody was coming to the marathon's store it was peaceful in there me hoods who have been enemies for over 20 years there with each other lighting the candles holding one another crime in another I'm - I'm telling you man blood I grew up around this stuff so the see it was unbelievable right it's like hot al holders ain't raised the sit yo it was like a movie like how the hell is happening and because of that that told everybody across the planet if they can get together as enemy hoods in LA yeah we can absolutely end racism here we can end bigotry here we can stop this if we can change the world and come as one we could be become one brother and fight as human family so I think that this message is we are the book that you were talking about and all the things that are in it comes writing one time we were talking about earlier recently economists say that Social Security is gonna run out of money there by 2035 they'd been run out of money you know we were saying so for the generation the Millennials now they are in more instant entrepreneurship like it was just like how it was encouraging people to do things like that so that takes away from or so they're saying that you know the people that are older hmm they're the one that would have been paying into their Social Security so they're gonna be just left out and so Millennials may be left to take care of their parents yes and their children in yourself Edison and yourself at the same time see all right see this is this is why I love doing what I do and I'm only saying is because when you're dealing with this yeah and things like this my major in college was political science but I like this girl oh yeah what's a cop oh I didn't graduate intentionally though yeah yeah yeah I could have went got my degree but I said he'll and I'm not about to give that indoctrinate not to hit and none of my brothers an HBCU yeah yeah well you talk yes papers you got to do it the only thing is for me I just knew me just me personally you know I just couldn't do it me but for you y'all need to do it because we need some infiltrators in their system okay to get through this y'all do that facts but I'm gonna tell you one of the major things that my college professor who was a an alumni for UCLA political scientist this man said when it comes to politics he said lying is regular yes he said like a standard yeah in politic if you want to get somewhere you must lie that's regular most honorable and Mohammed said this politic means multiple bloodsuckers poly meaning multiple t is a bloodsucker multiple bloodsuckers what the hell do politicians do to the people for the majority right that's number two number three if you're going to play this game if you're gonna lie about economy you have to tell the masses that you don't have certain things but you do have certain things you exaggerate you got a stretched up because if they told you everywhere was 63,000 dead if they told you that china owns most of our seaports if they told you that some of the bridges in certain states are owned by Spain if they told you that a lot of the different countries that they are going into for democracy purposes are actually countries that they are invading to take the natural resources to recoup money to give to the international bankers to lessen the debt so that they don't get smashed on listen it's it's a lie that's my plan if you got a damn liar and the people who are economists are being lied to and the people who are political students are being lied to everybody's being lied to from the top down I mean we're know America's been broke since the early 1900 you talk about 1913 1914 since the Federal Reserve was created okay to the debt was a little over a million no little rebellion dollars that wasn't much at all but since then up and so now America's over 60 trillion America's not even worth that much right let's just make that clear and the bonds are worthless basically Oh bro Fort Knox is empty all 12 of the reserves in this country are empty there is no gold why the hell would you tell me if I'm sitting at home and you put a commercial that says sell your old gold right yeah I see that sell your gold and we'll sing you paper yeah yo right yo it look reason I know y'all thought about that yeah come on question for you too man kid I used to always ask this do we make currency what it is so pretty much we're just handing out paper but who told you that it's valuable okay like all we're doing is just handing out a green piece of paper when gold is gold silver rubies that's the true value so how how is it that we're we're so controlled now that we're just passing out papers they convinced you to put a value on something that is invaluable valueless literally it's paper it's actual paper you can rip it you can repeat this it's paper yeah there is no value to that dollar there is no value to lacking it like they say that there is right it's an IOU this is why okay when you're dealing with this money thing listen women it's usually when Instagram start ripping that right you know usually when you're talking about the economic system the financial banking system in America you are now going into certain territory that's above religion and that's above just they don't want you to know this so when you're talking about this number one john f kennedy was assassinated killed and murdered yeah because he was giving the power to print money and to own money and to maintain when he back to congress according to the Unites States Constitution where it belongs he was taking it from the Federal Reserve a gangster group that ain't got nothing to do with this country nothing to do with the Constitution where is Federal Reserve in the United Sates Constitution no where they are a gangster group on the outside when you're dealing with this you have to understand anytime you start talking about money currency gold silver you're talking about warfare now hmm you know why dammit ron was talking about North Korea because North Korea has over six point seven trillion dollars of mineral wealth Wow and so he had to make him look like a boogeyman so that they could try to push a war to go over there to kill them to take the mineral resources pretty simple the Honorable missles Farrakhan brought that out and said that's why you're talking about North Korea mr. Trump yes sign is small so I think that about the bomb what's your line let a real translator from North Korea translate in English what kim jong hoon is saying i mean he's gonna find out [ __ ] you're lying you're a liar i don't know i don't wanna hear no white man telling me what a Chinese are asian man is saying in English okay no no no tell me what he's saying from somebody who's standing right next to him who has his best interest because they gonna tell you the truth it's like me asking questions about a [ __ ] from somebody who never bang I don't need no no no I need I need to can you you affiliated can you tell me what this is because you're lying so my point is economic system JFK was assassinated because he signed into law executive order 1 1 1 1 0 where he removed the power from the Federal Reserve to print money and gave it back to Congress that was war so they say we kill this we go we are going needs take him out and so they said oh he was oh he was killed and we don't know what killed oh you know exactly you kill him you hired the person who killed him and then you made everybody will question him being assassinated you call it a conspiracy theorist that's where the term came people questioned the assassination JFK they caught us conspiracy it is a conspiracy what is conspiracy it means two or more individuals or groups coming together to do something that is wicked or evil conspiracy is a real thing engineer is a theory ain't so it's like know if I'm questioning you because I see something that don't look right then damn it it don't look right man and it's saying today the same thing things don't look right so basically last point on this they're trying to keep us straggling along with this government they're trying to keep us affiliated with this government because they know we waking up a little too fast and we're finding out that actually this country is broke so we do need to be investing in silver gold physical silver gold Bitcoin to a degree if you want to do that we need to do things that have nothing to do with this paper with these white faces on it right we have to because once the dollar is gone it's gone you got in your pocket right now you're like I'm gonna use it yeah we're gonna use it because people on a local level still bro trust me yeah you will see one day when the president announces that the paper you have if it's still here yeah this is worth listen you know you're gonna find out how we can you know a family in Africa go back so I'm gonna happen and because of that I'm just Minister Farrakhan the most honorable Arjun Mohammed in his book titled the fall of America he said once this government goes down a pardon me he said once the dollar collapses the government is going down behind the dollar hmm the dollar was collapsing what happened now the government is going crazy they're going insane because they no longer have a hold on the minds of the people they don't know what to do so what they gonna do keep pointing at everybody else Muslims and al-qaeda immigrants now a Mexican who is their biggest immigrant - you're just talking look white folks they are immigrants we have white associates yeah I have them too I do too we found that why folks the biggest immigrants on the planet who need a green part to be on earth is the Caucasian this make this very clear can you say European because the original European is black yeah you're real they don't come from Europe or Phoenician goddess Canaanites black folks in your pants black folks but the point is so in order for you to be in America you the only person with a green car needs to be a black person if you want to go to the 18:25 or 1828 Noah Webster's dictionary on the definition of the word American it means a copper color individual copper colored individual indigenous to this land but now applies to those who are Europeans who are the children of the descendants of Europeans on this land so the original Europeans are apartment the original Americans are black folks you want to call them Moors fellows all mixed Aztecs Incas - whatever bro we've been in here is an Indian splat fault so the point I want to just say that for anybody wants talk about our Mexican brothers who are a third African yeah so wanna go and say that so let's go so next time because that one I saw on TV years ago and it kind of raised a red flag for me and you've been very vocal on pharmaceutical companies yes vaccines medicine when I started seeing commercials on TV for medicine I thought to myself this was years ago I mean I don't know I don't know if anyone remembers the days before farms little country started doing commercials but that kind of raised a red flag for me now we're in a situation where some local state governments are saying hey if you don't vaccinate your kids you're going to jail yes if you don't vaccinate your kids you're gonna have to pay a fine you know it's got to the point where people have stopped vaccinating their children and now they're scaring us with this measles and mumps outbreak I don't know where that came from because I know people that haven't vaccinated their kids and I mean like generations of people that didn't vaccinate theirs and this is not something new but you have been very vocal about it you and so what do you think now is that gonna be the next scare tactic to tell everybody that the measles is like you know they scare all week I've seen it on the news every day do you know that someone has the mumps hours away from you like every every so often you know what I mean in the pharmaceutical companies putting commercials out and I'm like okay so am I supposed to go to my doctor and say hey I saw this commercial for we're freezer or whatever so can you give that to me because based on what this commercial said like how did they put the hands of the people to make these these decisions well I'll tell you this number ones just to understand that when it comes to vaccinations and pharmaceuticals that is the number one way by which they can be populate a large population where the people will accept it come on out we trust our doctors right we're white coats psychologically when you see the color white you feel innocence and purity that's why anything that you see white its innocence purity Jesus is white white is snow white white white okay black cat' bad luck black chocolate oh yeah everything black right see if you black us for a funeral brother casa black for funeral white to weddings and black chocolate is definite white cake angel food cake as I hold on god damn it it's everything black is wrong interesting interesting when it comes to these vaccinations one the United States government as it pertains to Caucasian people they are in a reverse negative birth rate this is according to you more white people are dying than are being born this is why 78 to 90 or 70 80 to 85 percent of the abortion clinics are in black and impoverished neighborhoods because they encouraged us to abort while more of fertility clinics are in white neighborhoods because they can't have babies so they're trying to help them with their womb so that their children can go all the way through to a full-term nine and a half months now that I also put that in hidden colors five which is coming out as well yes yes so now because of this they have been trying to get rid of us with vaccinations it's not getting rid of us fast enough they've been trying to it with AIDS and other diseases now get rid of as fast enough with genetically modified organisms in our food it's not getting rid of us fast enough with strategic police assassinations of us it is not getting rid of us fast enough locking us up in prison not getting rid of us fast enough have enough prisons to put us in there have no buildings etc etc so what they're doing is they have to now push something as you said and as you were saying a scare tactic a fear-mongering push to say there is an outbreak of something that majority or the majority according to the CDC's Center for Disease Control's website as well as the vaccine adverse events reporting system or the veilleux's system a part of the Health and Human Services website a government agency the majority of people who die from measles mumps any of that is less than 1% in America make that clear if that's the government website over all these people talk they don't even go to look for themselves less than 1% these people die from it let me ask you this question why is it that between 2004 2014 zero people died from the measles mumps rubella but at the same exact time 108 people died from the measles mumps rubella vaccine according to the vaccine adverse events reporting system and the CDC's website itself see nothing I'm saying is gonna be a lot of lies gonna be all factual but the problem is and I just said this on sway a couple days when I was when I was in New York yeah it could you can believe any like what the hell do you mean it's like bro the only people who were not educated are the number one people affected by it and that's black folk the MMR vaccine is the exact vaccination that the senior lead scientist dr. William Thompson of the Center for Disease Control who currently right here in Atlanta and surprisingly what's going on with the people in Atlanta health-wise okay bro this man Caucasian man admitted this all of this we hit the data we destroyed over a hundred thousand pages of information proving and showing the connection between autism in black boys or they say African Americans two point three six percent two hundred and thirty six percent higher likelihood and black boys getting autism than Caucasian boys from the MMR vaccine five hundred percent increase in getting autism and black boys than Caucasian boys from the hepatitis B vaccine row that's right we didn't know this yeah we did baby they make you I mean that's a part of the criteria to get to register and oh that was my point yes that's the point now so because of that they're now forcing which is destroying a constitution this makes they don't you know about that but they're forcing you as parents they're forcing your children as well to get these vaccinations or one you can't go to public school you can't go to private school and you can't go to bake care this is the three things right yeah in California Mississippi and West Virginia now as hit New York and then it's gonna hit certain other areas they are fining parents in New York a thousand dollars a day if they don't New York LA right when I was leaving Italy now la is under quarantine at UCLA Cal State LA I just spoke at Cal State LA about a week and a half ago what you mean are you talking about UCLA how you have one of the best medical centers in the world the hell you talking about so you tell me now your Medical Center doesn't work see well hold on wait wait now it's an outbreak how many people got it well if you don't know of anyone that has it yet does what you say well know if anyone has it but the potential well and they also said that measles mumps and all that is airborne Wow so now anybody can have it so they make it so vague so blatant confusion to where everybody gonna be scared of everybody and they said well you know what you do this is you get you back to nation oh you know what else will get it let's give a [ __ ] bro not knowing that this is the exact vaccinations causing autism and black boys admitted by the scientists whose science is so the whole world uses to prove that vaccines do work because they did they don't you they let you they let you go to school at one point yeah if you had a letter saying that because of either religious reasons exist you have an exemption exemption form your K can go to school but now they're like oh no they declared an emergency in some parts of Brooklyn and they're requiring you to get a vaccine it's crazy how flew up out of nowhere all I could think about was you and how so many more people need to hear about this yes ma'am I don't know what your recourse is because you know I would say no you know people ask me all the time and I'm like I'm just glad I don't have any kids right you know like my daughter is 24 years old I wouldn't I don't even know what to tell you yes but I would say read your book yes watch your videos you've done extensive research for years and so people should definitely follow for the reason and find out what he has to say about it because you will not be disappointed and I know he can't go into all of it right now not just well just knowing that there is this scare tactic and that what the government continues to use yes um you know just do some research on them I'll say for all the parents all the people even if you're not parents here's another thing that I this and this is why I hate being right about negative things yeah nobody should be proud to be like I told you yeah I don't I want to say that about you know you winning something or you know I got that bill now I told you I'll get it for you like that's cool damn this right here by the year 2020 all right and because you're in Atlanta it's up to y'all now to really look at this man it's starting by the year 2020 they have a new program coming out called healthy people 2020 all right and this is a new system where they're gonna roll out over 300 new vaccinations Wow for these mystery diseases where did they come from what are you talking about and they're not going after children alone they have all these new vaccinations for children and adults yeah and preteens like what I remember when my daughter was in high school they were asking if she wanted the HPV yeah yes no and and the reason why I'm saying this is so everyone can understand learn to say no right you have to say no matter of fact it's gonna get physical now there's nothing about I got to get dude a head you need to exercise I'm gonna see you training more bro I've been uploading video when you're making your videos and you have on your head I just always assumed you're just out jogging you know that make sure the wheel starts and I bet that's what he does can you know you you're out there your nature you know your God is talking to you turn your anything I think in my head anyway that's what you're doing no that's that's true usually I know really it's either before or after I'm working out before before after I'm going to any events something because I know where this is going yeah they have been sending tanks into California since the 90s yeah German tanks they've been sending more tanks in recent they were doing drills and downtown LA video you know it's crazy with which one like they had that something they were blowing up a car or something like that oh yeah our testing they're doing drills you'll see more military helicopters in LA right now than you've seen a little very long time they have been doing drills why because LA one is the largest psych base County meaning more people are on psychotropic drugs in LA County than anywhere else people number two they are preparing because in California if laws or bills are passed and become law in California the likelihood that they'll become long to the states is very hot yes they do that in Texas too yeah is California Texas New York Florida trustus yes and then politics of the the I believe that statement is as California goes so goes the country because if you get a pass there oh it's gonna go right cuz you know Hollywood and Beverly Hills people when he like them so let's do what they do right right so everyone should be preparing you need to be exercising get your health better you don't have to be vegan but iron court I encourage you to eat more vegetables more fruits exercise know a lot more water I'm talking about at least a half a gallon to a gallon a day of water do some cardio every day stretch every day working a exercise but to be honest with you you have to learn how to fight with your hands some of y'all want to get your gun license do you think I'm stealing but I'm telling you learn how to use these because if you don't have no other weapons this is what these your elbows and your boxing get get it in because you need to be prepared you want to know how to do it okay you don't want to be in a position where you can't do it but you need to know how just in case were condones don't shoot me dangle work no brighter you don't get bribe like that study so I'm only saying on that because there is a bill being put before the legislators in California a b-26 - I believe where they are pushing it says to control a disease by any means necessary which means they are going to and if you end I mean they are going to be able to come to your house uh kick down your door and if you tell them your child is not vaccinated you refuse they're going to take your child they're already doing this by the way they've been doing this research takes take your child inject them with all the vaccines take you to jail this is what they have done to multiple people and this is what they will continue to do but now they're pushing to making a statewide mandated law and if it gets passed in California is going to rest the rest of the country it sounds crazy the movie quarantine was real the purge is absolutely I was thinking about that - absolutely where they are pushing to go and it's not a joke I know you're like damn damn reason what Dana my wish I didn't know this stuff and I wish it was fake yeah but it's real yeah so because of that need to prepare cuz everybody else is prepared ya know five your white girls black holes can be victims no more ma'am you gotta get a hint of this parents not being behind so where does a young so there is an election coming up y'all in eighteen months yes there are twenty people running on the Democratic side here they are that's like three black folk huh yeah they have a couple of black folks I've never heard a way meson before but that's a black man he's running yeah um Joe Biden just announced that he's running he was he was the first person to announced himself and be a front-runner automatically was from the we were talking in a few minutes before we started recording and you know and you asking who was Democrats was Republic how do we get rid of shrunk I think at the end of the day everybody just wants to give it a Trump I know that we need to form our own party black people I really do I think that whoever wants to get on board with us can get on board with us but I think it needs to be established yes and I know that you spoke about that as well but what do you think like we are so lost honestly I'm gonna say it is I like Trump now hold on look it's all hail no hell no exactly rise the only white man to get in that office to say everything about you yeah you and you think I hate you know you mr. what he's like I'm a devil would you expect it I don't like you to even told his wife I survived they like damn even the people around him are like oh my god yeah he's like you what you thought two-time Trump damn it right research my name put some respect on my name like it's like yo I love Trump for being an honest white man yes because it whipped us into unity he slapped the hell out of us he woke us up for real like oh damn like this they really don't care no hate crime skyrocketed after he was put in office people started getting shot again more mass shootings were happening all of a sudden white folks killing all these people and all of a sudden getting you you're off now the white dude who just did that shooting at the mosque over in Europe he's taken in like he's a nice little boy and they're trying to negotiate things like that I mean I'm like this right here Trump has has pushed us to come together whether we like it or not that's one too politics is what we have to stop relying on as a people the Chinese don't give a damn who gets elected why because they own land the attires don't give a damn who gets elected why because they own land the Jewish people somewhat care because they kind of run politics but for the majority they don't really give them because they own land they own property whoever is elected that's fine but guess what you gonna come get this Chinese food we're gonna get your nails did why because I own this you go get gas then do we own things black people have to focus more on buying land owning businesses but specifically in the important areas of medicine agriculture of course business but law education so we need schools hospitals farms grocery stores we need the basics because if anything shuts down we need to be self-sustaining thanks self-sustained I don't need to be able to go to some I don't want to have to go to somebody to get something that I should be able to grow my damn self mmm I don't want to have to go to you to educate my child one let's go to educate my children myself I don't have to go to you for transportation because I should own my own buses my own planes my own airlines what black airline do we have mmm that's right and we're gonna go a Segway this point into ice cube in a minute I need to have my own everything why because no one respects a beggar no you can't say nothing at a table if you ain't got nothing to bring to the table and that's why Trump always makes those comments like oh well you know the blacks we've got we've got unemployment low like he just always the way he talks about I want to say Democrats were the ones who wanted to keep slavery intact while the Republicans when it's it not it hasn't people don't know that yeah you know he said I'm a Democrat yeah dude I mean well in the nation by the way cuz some people are asking that question the nation do you guys vote for the majority no but if we do sure but the most honorable elijah muhammad said vote as an independent okay we don't we're not mixed to all the parties have done something yes because we're like not you are not in the best interest of us we don't depend on your system the nation of islam has independent schools we have independent farms we feed our own people for the majority we educate our own people for the majority yeah have businesses we have a number one independent publication on the planet black caught the final call and we also now have NFA studios taken over the digital world too so we're not too well of course my brother man brother Bennett bro please we we not playing out here there and because of that I'm not begging the white man feeling confident about what you said mister white man yeah I don't know I've know it my posture is straight I'm highly intellectual and I'm hood at the same time so you come to me either way you won't you won't get this work yeah and the thing is I'm not going to be afraid of you matter of fact I'm sorry I don't even care too much about matter if I didn't even exist like that that's the system you created does right and that system is what we are overcoming now but at the same time I'm a little busy focusing on empowering my people so that we can become free independent and separate and with the best in civilized society rather than focusing on being a part of you and begging you on time but you will pay what you owe so let's not get it twisted reparations you damn right it's come and we want that in the form of eight to ten states with an outlet to the sea and ocean so that we can have international training connections so we've really got to rely on you for nothing that's an actual planning knife in the back of every final call newspaper that's been in the back of every final call newspaper for over forty five fifty years Walker all those guys they try to do that beforehand I mean we appreciate your apology South Carolina but we'll take the port right they apologize yeah that was cute Charlotte actually the town some of the candidates are running on that you know they're saying that they are for actually it's not reparations so to speak they're putting together a council to discuss reparations that's what they're saying Sheila jackson-lee out of Texas proposed in she said she came up with this bill and so people are weighing and on how they think and if you look at some of the twenty people that are running for the Democratic Party there they they go up and every time they are doing interviews that's something that people ask them off and they're making it be a thing you know what I'm saying so people are saying yes yes Bernie I think he said no but he had a reason why he said no but you know I don't know how important that is to everyone I think that we should make it a thing I think we should care on them and I think that we should make them at least do this research and have the council if for no other reason because every other to educate people to educate people because they don't know because they never had to know because the privilege allowed them to live their lives without having to know any of you yeah that's really and we talking about reparations right yeah I've hip-hop daily all right I'm just saying this real quick reparations for the Chinese were given after they will put in internment camps in America they were given twenty thousand dollars per person yes yeah clear number one number two the Jewish community or should I say Israel Israel Atlanta was actually stolen Palestinians in great body Europeans in America know that nonsense the original Jews are us for Hebrew Israelites happened to be us black folk yeah those are askin Ozzy aka Kazarian Caucasian Jewish people from the Caucasian mountains or the caucus mountains of Europe anyway just exclude a time last point they are given billions by the way four to six billion every year since the 1940s they were given 38 billion in 2017 for a military contractor they've been given more money then black folks have ever been given but we were enslaved and we went through our entire process here for 400 years y'all had a holocaust that lasted 12 years and it's still being brought it's a question of how legitimate that really was and you don't say all the other people you say six million Jews five million others goddamn no other five maybe not we're not even worth a large chunk of that others happen to be black folk in Europe they don't tell you about that another part of that is people question the why because they don't feel himself was Jewish I ain't gonna go into that hoody right I trying to get y'all channel shut down no black station black stations yeah we gonna keep going the point is when it comes to reparations everybody else including many different of the Native American tribes or native tribes in America they were given reparations including land as well multiple people were given reparations the Italians were given reparations because America hung eleven Italians at a seaport and they apologized and they gave them money because it like sorry about that uh you know they were kind of dark so sorry originally times were black right so it's kind of like damn my bad so they hung them but they gave them money the only people they have not given money or not even our forty acres and a mule to happens to be the number one group of people who built this country including the money that we have helped them to a mass by building everything including Europe including all these other countries through the cotton mills through the tobacco industry through everything our sweat blood and tears put you in a position to where you can become millionaires today puts you in the position to where you can call yourself a billionaire today yet you'd want to give us a goddamn dollar even though all of that money belongs to us and our families because your families were the ones who put our families in the condition that they're in so no white today who are in this generation did not commit slavery but you are the number one been affected benefiting from what happened to a past generation through slavers so the point is reparations we are old but here's the reason why I'm not gonna pay for it because America's over sixty trillion dollars in debt between 45 and 50 million black Aboriginal Asiatic moorish people whatever in America black people they're between 45 to 50 million of us if you multiply 45 to 50 million by the amount of money let's just say $8 an hour standard you know minimum wage if you multiply all of that it's going to come up to a little over fifty one point two or fifty two point one trillion dollars which means America ain't got the money and because of that that's why they don't want to pay reparations it's not because of nothing else other than we broke broke and but the solution to that is guess who benefited all the countries in Europe so who should be giving up some money to pay you know all the countries in Europe everybody else was a part of our slavery including some African country yes and that's really got to be honest some of our brothers they helped to push into slavery why because they didn't they know they didn't know the backs of the backs were against the wall they were afraid and so they helped to you know show the Europeans where to find us etcetera so everybody who benefited from a needs to divvy up and repay it was good business well get the Pope get the Pope autumn Cardinals giving them rapists pedophiles right baby up all that money you spending on juice boxes and Lunchables all right yeah no all right all right y'all got me on one day I'm so sorry I love it bro it's that time five hundred thousand dollars to the immigrants at the US border who right now are being kidnapped by a malicious that's like that formed at the border like just people just taking it upon themselves to self-police the border which is right up trumps alley they'll never get in trouble for this they you know why people do stuff like this all the time up Creek they set militias up and they'll never get those those labels on there so now they're down at the border and they are malicious of people are just like taking taking migrants they see migrants and they take them and they turn them over to ice yes they take it upon themselves this is what they do like everyday this is just like hunting to them they go when they find immigrants yes so the Pope is trying to help these people out so he donated $500,000 you know these are the kind of people that Trump is like him you know making empowering them yeah cool yeah the Pope donated five hundred thousand yeah literally the building in the Vatican the Vatican itself sits on top six to eight miles of storage space underground that has our gold that has some of our original artifacts and has a lot of things that belong to us from all of the spoils of war when they were concrete original people first of all give us all that that's number one and then to give us some of the trillions of gold that you have in there and then let's swing it over to Queen Elizabeth yes they don't talk about this snatch all to go back sis because we know about your black connection your black family which is why they allow allowed Megan they allow Megan the half they try to reel in yo please first of all the only reason why that woman is still alive is because they have blood rituals okay where they sacrifice children by scaring them and it's adrenal chrome which is a mixture of blood and adrenaline put together which they call the Fountain of Youth that's Noble let's be grass and how she so lodged she's not a very good diet oh please please number two the next thing is that when you're dealing with England all these countries in Europe they once steal own parts of Africa yes number one I believe French still owns a part of Ghana etc etc that's one two they still have the majority of everything that they took from us so they owe us all of that and now they are being pressed hard they're being pressed by most of the leaders in Africa they're being pressed by certain leaders over here in America and the a BOS or the African descendants of slaves movement which of course has always been a movement just now it's a different name you've always been on the same thing we are social media that has to be pushed but it has to be connected across the Diaspora we need to connect with every single after a nation with those who are influential within those Africa nations including every single leader here on the on this land in America so that we can should I say emphasize increase and enhance our power because they were discussing reparations and the Geneva Convention I believe at the United Nations in 2016 and they were going over different ways by which they can give reparations they were talking about debt consolidation credit that's not having to pay taxes etc and the last option was money the last one but I don't know you can give us all that anyway so so no so it needs to be pushed that way but we need to also like I said connect because they're trying to squash our numbers in America and they're trying to put us against one another yeah religiously and politically it's like no fr2 politics you're a black person you're an African descent of a slave okay even if it's 1% okay yo come together let's make this happen I don't care about your religion I don't care like I really don't the Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan say we can argue over religion after we are free I don't care about Terry I'm like you look like me so let's handle business any one who was against that cool move out the way if you win it let's go yeah I don't care about anything else because our time is ticking is very short by the year 2020 it's a bunch of stuff coming out that is going to uh it's gonna horrifically slow us down from being able to make this progress we got about a good six months five strong ones to get this [ __ ] together and I mean now or else is gonna be very hard when the year 2020 comes around trust me man speaking on stuff phone his bag man Ice Cube big three he's actually doing his own thing I love it oh yeah love our brother and right now he's trying to expand right yeah so because he has the viewership yes but recently he said companies like charter wanted to keep the old world yes and we'll bend the rules to do business with the same people in the same tire way so pretty much they're not trying to put cubes in the game and an earlier you said television yes Oh telling lies through vision through the media as well so how is this impacting Ice Cube on Ice Cube did a beautiful job say this real quick Ice Cube is the same Ice Cube right he the same no Vaseline Ice King he the same I don't care about these white crackers Ice Cube he the same one I'm just and that's what he said the nation in my people don't know that brother dr. Khalid Abdul Muhammad may Allah be pleased with all of his good was the strongest soldiers yeah every animation Islam one of the hardest driving representatives of the Honorable nurse was Farrakhan and the teachings of the most honorable our mama we love brother for all the good works he has ever done he is who brought ice cube in let's make this clear yeah and ice cube was he was all the way yeah Oh his lungs changed in media yeah he was so he was he was hidden he was hidden the enemy so hard there was like yeah yeah yeah man let us let okay give us some time like relaxed no Ice Cube was with it and he's still with it the difference is he saw how the direct approach worked and he was like dan I can't get too far with this so now he went with the indirect approach for the last 20 years almost 15 20 years so now he has become so successful financially he has become so influential it's become so widespread with what he can do business-wise etc he's got in certain doors of Jewish community certain doors and wife votes politics he can do a lot of stuff happen he had to play the spook who sat by the door he had to do this strategically some people like not Nagiko know bro these are like that so the reason why they are trying to stop him is because he's becoming too influential one to last year I believe he brought the honor of missiles Farrakhan to one of the game I didn't know that and put him on the floor the floor seats next to taraji P Hansen and what city was this on national television I forgot what's he got see but it was right there the minister was right there with our supreme captain brother Mustafa and he was right this tower taraji pants was sit next to national television taraji pants and get some phone television on the cameras a full box and she said I'm sissies I'm sorry about saying this to Minister Farrakhan and I might go crazy right now they like dismiss we trusted you cube God beer you know virility and that pissed them off because white folks for that let me say let me say this the system of white supremacy and those who do its bidding it's not all white people but if the system of white supremacy that can't stand the Honorable this was Farrakhan or the nation because we speak the truth and we're not gonna let up your back is going to be broken backwards if you continue to do that all the [ __ ] who you in your suits and try to bring them up to us will fall we will destroy every one of them you will never get away from what you owe us you will never escape the the position that you put yourself in by torturing our people for this long you will give everything that you own you will have justice from us and with us and around us we will have freedom and equality we're not playing and we're not letting up and that's why they get confused because they think it ain't y'all like the n-double-a-cp ain't you like the urban National Action Network no we're not just talking right you won't give us what you owe this passion is fire you see came from Farrakhan yeah it ain't happen for the mauka but the color that's all there yeah and it's not changing that's why my name is brother Reza Islam with an X I have an X as well we always he never dies it never dies whether it's okay and they thought they killed it okuu the last one is Farrakhan because it's 85 oh you think so you can't kill a revolutionary which you can a revolution go ahead I'm with you though by the way Brett Hansen 20 Matt 2020 brother study when he was young his mother will tell you an interview on YouTube Fred Hampton used to study what the Nation of Islam see go YouTube hanging out the Muslims I know where Martin Luther King talks about that tectum one Luther King honey nobody classes that long nobody talks with it what bro yes it's so much history but the point is that everything that you see what Ice Cube and everybody else who affiliates with Minister Farrakhan yeah they will but they'll be attacker no matter how high you go up and no matter how much trust you build up with them at the moment you show and you bring this man yeah to the network that we helped you to get you know like we allowed you to get it's like a slap in the face how dare you betray us and so that is why because his influence is getting too big and they know what he's going to do they know Ice Cube's gonna freeze people mentally through television just like Bill Cosby is trying to do sisters I'm not standing up a Bill Cosby if he did even though it's what white women and they were chasing after a married man okay whatever whatever sorry the point is he was trying to do the same thing with NBC Ice Cube was doing it with his own there working because of this that is something that they can't allow unless they know for a fact you're going to do it for our better interests and not black people facts that's the only thing so reason question for you too man is it possible for us to openly support people like you Farrakhan mounted mechs of course because even in school when I have class presentations I have white professors who get turned off when yeah who had only Malcolm X or T O'Connor so is it possible for people like me and Kim who have a platforms they'd like to openly support you guys and and still be able to do business with white net where it's white businesses the answer to that is yes more now than before it wasn't at all before now more so why because we have digital we have social media now now you can own a network and it's not directly owned by somebody else so you can freely put out what you need to put out at the same time well I will say this as a cautionary thing just has something to warn you about beforehand if you do not have a plan of separating and building your own right complete I'm talking County then we do not need them at all then I don't recommend you pump us as hard so I'm honored to be on here but then again I know the danger of you having us on here suede didn't really know who he who's bringing up then I'll spin new flames he was like he was like oh yeah Chickasaw Lee they deleted the whole line oh you got it oh good yea you better save this girl save it they say the video for yo we need our own you need your own but because because we are still connected to theirs you have to be unapologetic and the most polite way as possible right so you have to let them know you know what I understand family said you know so guys I get it right thank you but ok you guys can't stand what happened to your people right let's just say whatever you can't stand this right yeah then you know what III agree with that and I can't stand my people going through that so do you mind if we go ahead and do our own thing yep you gotta you gotta be soft like that it's a hold sway just posted something else about me on the story look at that suede doing this thing maybe you have to i'ma say I'm in a Sephora cargo say you got to have some big balls in this alright you have to have it what do you say testicles the size of Ray's yeah you have to have testicular fortitude or for my sisters all Berrien audacity hey you gotta you gotta step hard on the earth bro because now it's like it's 2019 why the

not a white person you have to so you can work very very true and you know what well one would you would like what you doing now continue doing what it is that you're doing right now bring certain people on also take the knowledge that you get now and move out on it like ASAP the farmers markets how we talking about earlier yeah dealing a business doing what other organizations or community organize organize a shion's that are doing things find out who's doing what connect with them and get in where you fit in don't sit here and allow us to come up here and talk and just spit this and be on the front line of y'all not backing us up no no we have a team I'm serious about this yeah cuz [ __ ] on internet yeah [ __ ] on the internet not black man to differ people to be she's yes [ __ ] on the internet are hired some of them by this enemy to cause the division and I'm just gonna say the Russians I'm just gonna say wife oh this is my spare White Russians are white too yeah you say why folk aren't gonna just leave it over there they wait to yes god damn it right here yeah you know like I said they they are working in codes why because the one group was not benefiting happens to be black folk when we got the number one oppressed on the planet yeah so it's kind of like why don't you figure out that you have the same enemy number one it is ignorant that number one enemy that we all have number two it is the system of white supremacy not all white people but the system knows or related by their ancestors that is still intact today benefiting them putting us out of that you meant the amount of benefit the point is you got to come together all the way and we have so as you said how do we get it going put the clips up that you feel impact the most right you feel can spark the ideas and then start going and having group meetings and invite the people who can network and who have certain solutions invite people who have farmers markets and invite business developers and invite potential investors who have the money and I didn't have to get this done you have to get it done now write up business proposals business plans find out who has what because a lot of our elders have land are we not talking to them right and they ready to sign it over to us out here in Atlanta okay but give them a proposed order give them a paper and say listen this is what we this is what we plan to do do you mind if we work with you in contract with you most of them won't even charge you to say you know what baby I like that right I like that you know what hear that whole back area that two acres yeah I ain't gonna make that into a farm go ahead I sign it off my there's there it is and go do that I'm talking about right now you can do this NASA Sunday they they couldn't make grass and some of them smoking and go talk to me say you know what brother Earl good I don't know I always got a Earl I never stopped early right do you have do you mind if we what are you doing with this land has just been my family for two years do you mind if we used that part of it just that area and make a farm for the community come to and we'll contract with you we make sure it'll stay clean you don't have to do anything and wokai will write it down let me see how I look okay yeah yeah I don't do nothing you'll be so we should do that so most of us don't even need to put up no money for this land you can go get it right now my first can I'm just saying that's just a nice theme that's what I'm saying sit down like the most honorable on Mohammed said get with five to seven like-minded individuals but not just like-minded those who are ready to go Wow so sit down have a meeting make sure you all on the same page if you say don't don't be someone if you want to get there just in which all talking about know what can I do all right listen that's what I got all right I have um I got a thousand right now all right just saved up and I want to invest it somewhere all right so what else you like I got five hundred I got two all right I saw this building I saw this land whatever okay let's do that we gonna put our names down draw up a contract we own this percentage of it and what would be the purpose of this land okay be the farm a school right whatever training facility whatever and you write it down it takes 2 or 3 days write it down seriously like write it down boom you'll all agree boom your signature yeah everybody has it and then you have your role who's gonna be the director of this it's gonna be this this this boom put it down alright print it up laminated copy it and make sure everybody has own copy and then you go to that place and get to work simple it's really that simple and then add security in that equation security security tree I'll say it this way you in Atlanta you're in Atlanta Georgia the Nation of Islam has [ __ ] 215 a and B we have a huge strong hole here there is there are many many brothers and I'll talk to you off the a I don't give his name out on here but we have security companies that we own here so we will contract with you security that's security we had no guns see the police with the guns was scared inlet reason you know it's crazy staff I'm just fine nobody nobody even approach more than we are of a bullet I mean them guns don't mean [ __ ] of course it's temporary we don't we run I'm gonna tell you how we are as Muslims but all original Muslims we don't follow air synopsis Caucasian religion whatever we are the original practices of that religious faith or way of life so we don't run from death we run to it this isn't in the Holy Quran we run to an honorable death is a beautiful death bro I'm not trying to cause one but if I need to if this sister need protection somebody coming through that door if my brother don't get to him first i'ma get to I like that is how we need to be people are yeah they will die to protect me when you see a rodent when you see your brother for the Nation of Islam because I'm from New Jersey and in New York it's like the presence is definitely oh yeah we got North so I grew up with it you know what I mean um but my family they're Muslim my mom is Christian my grandfather is an Ethiopian Jew so that's a nice mix yeah everything yeah let me tell you something these brothers are so disciplined yes their presence alone demands respect intelligence I mean as soon as you see somebody come in the room it's like immediately you like what's going on because it's that's just how disciplined they are and how strong they are in their faith yes so if you ever get a chance to go just I mean even if you don't convert or whatever but if you ever get a chance to go definitely go because this is definitely something that there's a lot to learn in this sense of family that you feel when you around them and the sense of protection ladies how you dealt with a Muslim brother you are a teen naho ain't nobody can't do you nothing honey ain't nobody gonna do you nothing you're gonna be just fine that'll oh yeah yeah yeah cosign by the black one like I said I was born and raised a Christian but I have a few family members shout out to my cousin Jahi he's got a restaurant in North that's right Jehan Mohammed and he their family that part of the family they always went to Muslim schools they always ate right I mean they always just had everything together it is something that you have to respect as a woman you want that kind of man to lead your household yes ma'am you always want to have someone as able to lead and protect and provide for you and that is something that they instill into their men in early on yes yes and that's an asset in minds you that is not dying yeah that way that we live in on it and practice it's not dying and of course we're not perfect now we you know we still you know striving we have that foundation yeah yeah we just we strive every day like you said it's a process man we ain't perfect we most of us I'm talking about gangbangers drug dealers we don't been through it all so we're trying our best to live this life and it's hard you know resisting all kind of stuff everyday but it's something that we need to do but as my brother was saying security that's the number one thing you want to make sure you have with it so we will contract with you I'm serious right here in Atlanta Georgia y'all find some places and I'll put you in contact with the brother who was a director over the dispensary already company that we have and he will you know like yeah here's the rates what's up let's work with Shaw we're not gonna gouge y'all for not listen which is got business and this blackness black-on-black helping one another and we don't need guns yeah I'm telling you they're already intimidated by rows yeah we exercise we train bro come on man okay if somebody if somebody bring a gun at us are you did you brought us the gun all right we not exact I've seen the video Oh bro bro Wow I love the lines of Farrakhan Oh bro yeah bro meet a lot Street yes he's a businessman he's a beast oh yeah reason last topic man little Naz X and Billy Ray Cyrus oh yeah yeah social media and I know this out in Nashville for the NFL Draft they had a billboard yes he's banned in people's front yards as well congratulate and they have Billy Ray Cyrus in or the Billboard itself saying congrats blu ray cyrus number-one hit but this is is it possible that that happens in two camps he was putting me on game so you show me the racist history behind oh people know about that right so yeah I will one first of all you talking to a black man who grew up in Richland farms Compton California the part of Compton I grew up in we have farms we have horses we have like four I grew up riding horses Wow like I'm safe as where sanaya you know I know it's crazy lying no I'm serious I'll say this way the the brothers who I grew up with maybe a drive-bys and horses all right now sounds funny Wow Wow in a real way and and because of that I'm telling you so country music we did you see you listening we we listen it'll be to pot in Garth Brooks I gotta be country music rap music hip hop record so yeah because we was riding we was riding bulls horses and everything so the point is I knew about some of the races history because the wait there were certain lyrics they would say this like yeah what do you just say you know he would say donkey Oh were here yeah there'll be some weird stuff and you have to listen to a bit that you're dealing with white people from the south right it the country the worst of the worst the ones who taught us English so we talk about where we talk about the broken because we got we learn how to speak English from the dumbest of the wife oh the notice of what room right yes he taught us how to speak because the people that came over here the Europeans that the Irish or whatever they want they were like the prisoners yes they say here to settle here they weren't like people Don George yeah experiments they send you down here to settle this land and they you know they went through what we went through some of them came over here whereas indentured servant yes not slaves because they were yes they were slaves but they only had to work for whoever they were looking for for a term yes we because we were black were slaves just for Harriet right but that music is like their glasses no that's their blues it is their Negro spirituals absolutely right country music is the Guaymas it's funny but it's sad they just in alive yes so I hope you can see like strawberry wine weird it's just great yes so we got our blues and they got that weird stuff banjos and all that so sigh and I did a history class in jazz and how they replaced the banjo with the guitar or not so they were like really straight-up crazy broke uneducated folk back and but they would always talk about black people in their music class because they were going through stuff but they was like but we still white though right it's just them in there mentally the only thing they could do to separate themselves from us because they were all poor they were all working we will all compete you are the only thing they could do was put their whiteness above our blackness that was the only thing that's what white supremacy is it's a myth and it's guys who can because it's so prevalent here in Atlanta enjoyed it in the house wait you know this yeah about this to 1906 racial rice oh yeah not speaking on that same thing white supremacy how people especially white men there's our food insecure because you have people like Alonzo Herndon you had successful black men that have black businesses yes and it was a whole riot going right yes so yeah that's all the time every time in that black business or the black banks got established black economics they always came and they tore it down I'm saying we had to get we have to have protection yes so that's why because every single time we've got to the point where we were on our own we don't shoot them cookin haters gonna hate no for real and in mind that's the main thing behind Tulsa Oklahoma it wasn't though we weren't success was that we were to success right we did not have protection because we believed that these white folks were different than their ancestors and that was the issue they proved at that moment no we're not different we just tolerating y'all right we don't like y'all how the hell did you come up out of slavery or reconstruction between 1865 to 1870 73 you got some of the biggest positions you're in high political office your teachers and your OE the doctors in ten years we had our [ __ ] down for hundreds and y'all passes up in ten and that's why those statues bro we did in three decades what they tried to prevent us from doing it three centuries so they're like how Wow all we did was prove that who really is superior by nature not competing but just feeding a thing then that we birthed y'all okay so I can't be better your parents but the point is okay so this is like less that's top of the notches so the main thing that Tulsa did not have was security they brought in German planes but sure a 911 trolls before not grow as they first were all tech roll like we said right right didn't ever go to war with Germany but guess what they still white right that's what ties them together but they brought in German planes bombed us the first bombs ever dropped in America on American soil was Tulsa Oklahoma killed all the people went in and they just fit everybody first they went in and took all the valuables from all the houses I didn't know this what bro yeah first man it was a scientific Manute it was over 2,000 Klansmen it was going all up through the city and they uses the militia hey what all happened they was like take all the valuables and any kill everybody in cold blood bombed everything shut down the streets and exit so that nobody could get out and in bone that was it and in the last people who survived the Tulsa race riots got bronze medals yeah they did in the stephannie right no no he gave one of the survivors one of the it was only other things we let them and the government gave them bronze medals and I was it to say first surviving the run surviving a run [ __ ] y'all some terrorists no I did you bomb me if my family took everything and no reparation no Reppert bro so society penis security is absolutely required you cannot is 2019 I know but this system still looks at you as though you are a straight up [ __ ] mmm yeah every white person but this is this stuff does and because of that you cannot pre you can't you can't pretend as though they won't do that right I hate was it they know how would they do that yeah yo there's no morality there is no you can't how are you trying to make a moral appeal to a system that was never built on any type of morality this is the most immoral system we was talking about reparations and yes and we said modifying to where we get a piece of government no one land as I was saying them I said the the most underlies Mohammed's economic blueprint he put it all and it was magnificent I put this together number one eight to ten states that's first thing land eight to ten states because everything that we need is in the land I mean California Louise Georgia Alabama all the fertile land in soil and I'm talking about at least one of these that has an outlet to the ocean so that we can make we can have our own way to get in and out of the country bring in business and commerce and trade import/export right the other point is set up our own government the US Constitution has been destroyed matter of fact this is not the first nor the second or the third constitution that they have they destroy it almost every year they don't give a damn about this constitution they violated almost every single want to be a minister the First Amendment is freedom of what religion speech press petitions assembly they don't give a damn by religion give a damn about freedom speech the press who owns them you talk to my petition they go get from over here assembly what the hell you are doing ok no they don't give a damn about the the amendments okay so what I'm saying is we have to set up our own government the Moors have set up some of that today to a degree the Nation of Islam we have our own Constitution see we can come together and just see what we agree with put it together and make it happen we have the resources we simply have not had the units well that's the problem so that's why I don't care about the religious if you are on more sons temple Hebrew Israelites good Christian Brothers Nation of Islam nation the gods and Earth's Papas and nations of God come together same enemies same exact situation freedom justice equality liberation come together put it together let's have a damn sit down with the best representatives from each group that have the same like-mindedness unless agree on this if you keep disagreeing you will not survive that's the point everybody else is agreeing that's why they're surviving your Chinese folk don't say you from Kowloon I'm from Hong Kong where your money my money we put together we buy stuff those black folk they eat our fried chicken or a fried rat right so that's what we need to do is set up our own government and get the land and once we do those two things that of course we should already have our unity together our own business plans everything together before we even get all that that way we get that we also get the funds because they gonna cough up some money hell yeah print some more like the minister said print more of it if you need to rains because we're gonna need that as well for capital and for exchange and then we can go from there we can make it happen in your travels through Atlanta and through the south you'll notice that you're gonna see some statues and some things that have been raised to honor so honor oh yeah bro - yeah and I'm sure you've seen in your travels some of these things and a lot of recent recently people have been tearing them down in legislation that's been passed in order let them tear them down do you think that we I think we should I'm all for whenever they tear them down I'll go and I watch it come down just for my age but I'm just saying do you think that it's a good thing do you think we're wasting our energy on that because it's not really getting to the root which is like the spirit of white supremacy but do you think just the symbols of white supremacy should be torn down the symbols of white supremacy being torn down gives our ancestors a smile okay it makes them smile I think this is so good yeah but the ultimate is destroying the system right that's wrong yeah so the statue feels good it feels it's like a woman who was cheated on by her man egg and her car's never tire by the window good you really do much but you know it's gonna make him he's gonna inconvenient make him lose a child alright feel good but it didn't really destroy his morality or immorality it didn't educate that brother to teach him a lesson on exactly how you supposed to operate any man right so you want to go to the root it's how we talk next we go straight to the Rubies going for the jugular system I don't give it about your toll you'll eat and give me your heart I want this system I'm sorry that's I mean I need this I want that system to come down I don't want to go into your system I don't want to integrate whether we need to save from it and establish our own everybody else has their own everything except for us that's why they don't care what white folks say about them you don't see the Asians protesting why broke because they know what's gonna happen if you see an age when have you ever seen a Chinese person get murdered by the police mmm think about this the moment they murder a Chinese person do you know what happens the Chinese people will leave America's economy will collapse yeah they're business agreements you'll be null and void no more Playstations and no more cars yes bro and that's real that's right yeah in the world correct and we haven't been taught what to do like I just read a book and it kind of made oh it was a marketing book so I had nothing to do anything but the statement that he made made so much sense he said that when the immigrants from other countries came over here the first thing they did was they started their own business but not that they once that they started own business but each immigrant nation had a gyro yeah like an apple and the salon the Indians have the 70 levels yeah they take a market yes master yeah but we sell our nation's and we sell it if any cuz I miss - yeah nobody talks about that see the point is that everything you just say was perfect is this why love me around like mine individuals what you just said is absolutely correct what they did was took everything that we were doing perfectly and made us hate it and then took it for themselves yeah so they now do it the way we did it by Nature now they have to artificially train themselves train ourselves and now they can do it perfectly males hair the Chinese people put a bold move in their countries and in Indian countries to take over the weave in the street be honest so if we can understand that they've made moves and they made us hate what it is that we already own what it is we do what it is that we excel at and they put a plan together steps and every one of them before they go over here they tell them chin this is the business you gonna go to he's like yes yes this is how you gonna do it yes here's the steps follow it yes this is we're gonna move - yes okay and they only agree with the steps and they follow steps through and they are United and they don't budge that's it unity is the point come together say okay brother you know about real estate how many real estate brokers in ages do we have in a black community y'all need to come together create your own when a hundred percent firm put all of them together F that's how I'm gonna do for me bro gasps oh nothing right damn you do not own as much land as you could on if you came to get there you go come together all the way be in then right up the steps so that other people can do it too and show them how to take over the market how to find all the niches in the market and how to go about snatching it when it's ripe and then how to invest in it Detroit should be owned by all like books right right now Atlanta Georgia should be owned by our black folks [ __ ] it should be on right now because the day it's going up prices are going up so take it over Minister Farrakhan said Atlanta no he said Detroit Detroit said we should take over Detroit said this two years ago and savings day was out they said we should be taking over Detroit find some land find a building buy it even if it's run down by it you knock it down you can refurbish it whatever you gonna do with owned is because once that property builds value which it will it always does then you will be able to make money from it own it create apartment complexes create duplexes whatever condos rent them out to the white folks there be hey y'all pay me back damn it I'm getting my reparations well where are they up yes that's how we have to do it so yes as you said brother financial literacy yeah everybody who's good in who excels in financial literacy and in finances they got to come together we should be having weekly classes and economics online online we should have that credit classes all modern how to run the game the Jews master did yes they will they own it okay but that's the point they know so we had all these basics in agriculture and economics finance we need to know that like you said because all we gonna do is get back to the white folks anyway exactly they should pale when you put that on that on the show it was absolutely accurate and guess what we came out of economic slavery and the debt was was gone in America went back into being prominent because the black folks giving reparations and they audited was spitting on cars and jewelry and it came back yeah so so they helped America they helped themselves we helped America the same time but they didn't establish any businesses or anything for themselves to where we could have economic or should I say future economic empowerment and I believe generational wealth man so yeah reason thank you so much me know I learned some this is to put yourself out there and to do with where the reason is doing is love I'm honor fact I think that black people we need to love each other more trust each other more end of the day we are all we have so when you see somebody when you see brother reason please buy his book shorter please buy his book if you are a millennial please buy his book because y'all yes the book is at Reza Islam calm if you follow me on Instagram click the link in my bio right now it's about 300 watching and on Twitter it's in on Twitter it's on it's to the top of yes it's on Twitter and said reason song calm it's on my

they used to they should I secured nasty person I secured here at a certain point I can say I protected this man's life Wow seriously that's what so this is much deeper man seriously so we're so we are in our artists are they are they're waking up in their understanding just one guy's that's all they want to know how can I do this that's it so we so we need to all come together helps another

talk real fast [Laughter] ",3
KLFFiD8BSrc,you have got a bit of a problem with the whole corona thing it's probably a bit deeper it's a major problem yeah you've got a bit of an issue with the continual lockdown and you are moving for good you're going to brazil because of what you think the government are doing in the agenda is that correct absolutely right yeah i'll see you real soon see you soon love you lots so that's it my dad's gone due to the government restrictions in the uk fair play i'll miss him one of the things that really ticks me off is when people complain about something but don't do anything about it when people say i don't like england i don't like the weather you have got a bit of a problem with the whole corona thing it's probably a bit deeper than that major problem yeah you've got a bit of an issue with the continual lockdown and now manchester's gone back into lockdown and you are moving for good mm-hmm yeah tomorrow even or the next day after the next day after that yeah so you're going to brazil literally the only reason is because of what you think the government are doing in the agenda is that correct absolutely right yeah okay talk to me about that okay so we've unfortunately been going through this the whole world pretty much has been going through this coveted pandemic we'll call it and most of us that critically think know that it's all a big scam um but there are certain countries in the uk the us certain european countries japan are being particularly targeted um and we're going to be seeing i think we all know we're going to be seeing more lockdowns and the lockdowns that are coming i believe are going to be soon and they're going to be much much worse than what we've previously seen they've got the track and trace in place they've got all kinds of things in place that they didn't have before they've got the population accepting pretty most of the population accepting that it's for our own safety that when we have people wearing masks driving in their own car um crazy stuff like that attacking others not wearing masks people are scared they've managed to get the fear level right up here and they're going to be using that fear to implement more and more loss of freedom yeah more and more um i mean there's some terrible stuff that that's in the pipes so so not everywhere is the same some countries are not operating some sweden even in europe sweden has had no lock down they've got on just fine so if you're in sweden you're going to be doing much better although that may not stay like that but so right now the uk which is where obviously i've been living for quite some time the uk is under target it's going to get a lot worse i want to get out obviously it's a good idea to fight it as well if you can but it's gonna come it's it's happening so another thing is people might think you sound crazy other people might think you sound sane but you actually because you're my dad right so and actually also my tenant so i'm losing a tenant and not losing a dad but also you know we see each other reasonably regularly considering you're in wales um but you predicted this was going to happen quite a long time ago you've been talking about this for ages so it was no surprise to you when corona uh was announced and the lockdown was announced you were completely cool calm and collected you're not moving to brazil because you're freaking out you're not moving to brazil because you panicked no why brazil well i have connections in brazil first off i have a permanent i prepared because i knew this was coming so i've got myself a visa a permanent right to live in brazil being a third world country in this situation is actually an advantage because it's the first world countries they're trying to take down um so that's why you're seeing a lot of this the worst effects of what's going on it's happening in in the strong first world countries like the u.s canada australia france germany uk these are the countries that are being hit the third world countries much much less here and brazil is a beautiful beautiful country i'm going to be on on a house by the beach it's you know beautiful beaches and sea that's just a lovely place to be um now i like the uk don't get me wrong i like the uk and it has been a phenomenal country but the direction it's going very much towards communism um i'm not i'm not okay with at all and the thing is i mean listen i've got i've got you on my channel i'm interviewing you you're a lot more researched than i am in terms of the the health side of things that's your thing i am not saying by having you on this channel that i agree with everything that you say and but at the same time i've said before on youtube something doesn't stack up right something fishy is going on it's very clear they contradict themselves left right and central i think anyone that can think should know that what we're being told is not true but the thing is they'll ban uh or brand anyone that speaks against it as a conspiracist they will remove i mean this this video will probably be taken down i imagine it will be like i've had videos in the past taken down yeah i've had the systems and the establishment remove my videos and people i talk a lot about the the system and the media even who are part of that system and people banned me like some kind of a uh conspiracist or whatever as if they're watching your videos as if they're no no they do yeah and it's obvious that they do because when a video suddenly just gets taken down as soon as it's not saying the message that they want to say i think it was the tanzanian president who talked about tell me a little bit about that so a lot of what they're basing everything on to empower them to be able to make these changes that they're creating the fear with is tests because frankly not many people are dying so they're using tests and the tests are supposedly there to identify a virus which they've claimed causes the disease they haven't even proved the existence of the virus they certainly haven't proved it causes a disease but those claims are out there and then they have a test for that and the tanzanian president clearly wasn't totally trusting them and so he he actually when they were sent when they got their tests he actually used a fruit so the test usually goes up your nose to the back of your throat well he instead of putting it in a human he did that but he put some of the in fruit some of them in engine oil all of them came back positive positive for covered 910 positive for kobit 19. there's other examples of people who've gone for testing there's been a big queue um they've ended up like oh this queue is too long they've signed registered in and they were in the queue and then they thought i can't wait any longer they've gone not being tested still got a test result come back positive without a test so there's lots of problems with the test like devastating problems with the tests but that's some examples that these some of these stories have made it to mainstream media now the big the real war is on information so the reason most people have a certain belief system is because that's what they're told by mainstream media so most of their information if not all their information comes through the tv the newspapers the radio etc and that information in a free country should be free right and you should be able to challenge information but we're no longer free so all of the information we're getting is very much um a specific agenda specific information and any information that contradicts that just like communist china except for its that we don't people don't know but just like communist china all that information is removed people are people are de-platform so people like david ike um as an example has been d platformed i mean you've had your own d platform stuff i've had my own d platform stuff but the people that reach a big audience they've all been removed so they just want you to hear one side of the story it's a very bad weak story with full of contradictions and they can't afford to have people critically thinking and challenging that so it's just removed so you can't speak so this video probably because it's challenging um the the mainstream narrative this video will probably go down but many many have already been many people um who are like as i mentioned like david ike and i don't agree with david icon lots of things that he says but some of the stuff he says is very very spot-on but he should have the right to say it yeah that's what i will fight for he should have the right to say whatever he wants to say we should all and in a free society short of telling sort of putting out a message to kill people or something ridiculous like that we should have the freedom to speak and that's what the west has always been about it's gone in one generation we no longer have that even even regular joe bloggs who's makes a little post on facebook about anti-5g is highly likely to get his post removed you know so they've now they've got their fact checkers who have a particular political position that they want now i i guess what they would argue would be that coronavirus is a real thing it's deadly people are dying over it and people like you that are saying actually it's not and it's a scam and it's it it doesn't even exist which is what you believe yeah people are saying that are gonna make people drop their guard down i think oh it's safe then and then they're gonna they're gonna go out they're gonna catch the virus and actually it's your message is going to harm people and that's why they're removing your message well uh there's a lot of people dying because of lockdown there's a lot of suicides that there's a lot of businesses going out of business there's devastating effects of lockdown so we can't say that one position is is just protective and everyone's going to be safe if we follow that and the other position is potentially dangerous because no both positions if you believe them and follow them have potential dangers depending on what you believe so however what we should be what we should be doing is we should be looking at let's look at the facts i i i'm into science i love science and i want to use science um to look at the science behind submit the problem is science is now bought and paid for the scientists i work with scientists and doctors and so on and there's a different conversation going on privately than can happen publicly so a lot a lot of the a lot of people in the world of science in the world of medicine they all know it's a scam but they're not allowed to say that because if they say that they get their they can lose their job for starters um they get called a um a quack whatever it may be so they're being controlled via various means to not put that narrative out i believe that the public each of us has the right to hear both sides of an argument and then they can decide if somebody wants to wear a mask after they've heard both sides of the argument that's fine but what they want to do is force everyone to wear a mask so what what is your argument what why do you believe that coronavirus doesn't exist the testing isn't correct what what evidence do you have to say that okay let's so that's the first piece of evidence if there was a pandemic a true pandemic we should be able to look at the deaths for 2020 so far this year compare it to the previous years and there should be a lot more people dying in 2020 than for example 2019 2018 17 16 right because there's now pandemic but actually there's less deaths that's the first that's a statistical fact there's less deaths in the first half of 2020 than there have been in the previous years for the last five to six years so that already doesn't make sense you're in a pandemic and we're having less deaths why is that why have we got less death so that that should at least raise a flag to say this needs to be looked at what's going on so now we're having lots of people dying and they're saying it's a death from kovid people let's not pretend nobody's dying of anything people are dying of course as they always have done that dying is just part of life people are dying from flu the difference this year is if you die from flu this year rather than last year this year they will say you died of covered 19. that's that's the only thing how can they just how can they just say that you died of covered 19 right very very good question so they have a number of tests the biggest test is something called pcr it's a test that they use where they're looking for certain fragments of rna dna which they say is a virus and and basically they look for this and if you've got this at a certain level they call you positive and then if you die they say you've died of coping 19. now the test is it's not just not accurate it's ridiculous the inventor of the test who won a nobel prize he himself said it cannot be used to to check for infectious disease viruses bacteria and so on it doesn't work for that so they're using a test that the inventor said doesn't work that's the first thing to understand the second thing to understand is that what they do is they they look for this these fragments of proteins and basically how it works is if they find that they then multiply that because it's not enough so they multiply it by a factor of let's say 40. so they multiply this by 40 and if after multiplying it 40 times it goes above a certain number they say you're positive if it's below a certain number then you're negative now first of all that 40 number they keep changing there isn't a specific so they just keep changing they've done at least 10 different numbers secondly 100 of people would be positive depending on what number they choose so they just choose a number randomly arbitrarily just like the six feet is arbitrary right they choose a random number and then call you positive if you're above it or that that's that's ridiculously not science but then what they're finding that they say is a virus they haven't proven to be a virus there's a very good argument to say that your own cells produce these fragments when they're under under assault so it's very very possible and i believe it's the case that our own bodies are making these things that they're finding what they're calling a virus they haven't proven it's a virus and they haven't listen if you've got a thing that causes a disease a bacteria a virus a fungi whatever a pathogen if you've got a thing that causes a disease if i took that let's say some of your saliva that contain that thing they say it does because they're testing that right so i took some of your bodily fluids and i then put it into a healthy person that healthy person should get that disease right okay they've never done that test never never done that that would be how to prove it causes the disease that's very easy to prove slightly more complex than that because they should isolate it first so that they know it's that bit of it that's causing the disease they've never isolated it okay in the sense of pure they use the word isolated and they use it there's a couple of studies out there where they say they've isolated it but they've they've twisted the word isolation so what they do is they take some let's say some phlegm from you and the virus is in that phlegm and they say that's now isolated but that's not isolate you've got to take the virus out of this so if the testing doesn't really work right who's in on this do the doctors know this do the the people that make the tests or is this just the i mean i mean it just sounds everybody accepts the tests i've i've had people um that have told me that their friends have died and they've said that they were covered positive yeah and i mean i'm just i'm just i'm struggling a little bit to understand well i think what you said right at the beginning the fact that you can test the fruit and it's positive or engineer when it's positive just proves that the test is useless yeah it's it's like if they did an alcohol test that you know and stopped random people and and and the thing wasn't even testing for alcohol i was texting to someone else and then they they do a conclusion that you were drunk that's that crazy so the tests you think are just completely completely and utterly useless to the to the point that fruit can be can be positive and it has been and it has been so they've looked that bad they've literally given the test to a fruit and and goats and all kinds of things have tested positive and who's not being tested i could tell you the cue they haven't even had a test and they're coming up positive so how are people dying of of this of this virus then they're not dying of a virus they're dying of other things what are they dying of flu pneumonia every everything that we've always died of there's been people who've been shot and they've died and they've been called kid19 deaths so now there is in my opinion there are some people dying of something newish um so there's a symptom that some of the people that they say have covered deaths where the blood is coagulating and what have you which is kind of new and that potentially the only deaths that you could maybe think well okay that could be covid that's a new thing in my opinion that's been caused by radiation poisoning that's 5g related and maybe vaccines are involved as well but i think it's more 5g so that's a great small group of people um that that are having symptoms that the doctors were originally described as like high altitude sickness um and that's an oxygen problem where you're not being able to take the oxygen but that's again it's not by the way the thing is though with a lot of stuff like that like you say about 5g you think that might be giving people radiation problems and and killing them yeah it just makes me think when whenever anything new comes about i remember when i remember when the internet came out and people thought it was evil and and then when wi-fi and then uh 3g and everyone moaned and then 4g and everyone moaned and now everyone's talking about how bad 5g is and i just think surely everything's bad everything's terrible and then it happens 5g is radiation so we know it's bad there's no question that radiation is bad the frequencies that are being used um on the 5d antennas are the same frequencies being used by the military as a weapon so it's not questionable it's bad they're trying really hard not to do studies so there's so that they can claim ignorance later um so there's not a lot of studies um but the studies we do have there's no question it's bad who wants to be radiated um it's definitely bad now the questions will revolve around how bad really it's not it's not a question of whether it's a healthy thing to be exposed to radiation of course it's not so it's how much radiation can we be exposed to before we start having results that's really the only question yeah okay so who's behind this and what do we do about it because it's all good saying you know that the covert 19 doesn't exist and the testings are false and everyone's get going into lockdown for no good reason and isn't it bad but what's the solution first of all let's just say that the opposing argument the people who are claiming that there's an invisible enemy that's getting into our bodies and causing us to die although they even they admit most people aren't even going to notice it which is another so you get the virus and you have no symptoms and you don't even know you've got it yeah i do think that's strange because when they first announced covert 19 and it became a thing it was a case of these are the symptoms you're going to have this this this this this and then the symptoms change started changing and then and then it was hay fever season may and i was sneezing a lot and then and then i read that hay fever symptoms could be covered 19. i'm thinking come on how many and then i'm thinking well i know i i you know i'm having was actually clearing up i'm pretty sure it's just have either i haven't got any of the symptoms i think i'm good and then he said you actually might not have any symptoms and you could have covered 19. yeah and it i just i was just thinking this sounds a little bit fishy this sounds a little bit fishy and they did the same thing with aids by the way but but yeah so it it it's very very clearly a scam one one of the you said who's behind it so the first thing to note is that all the major world governments are acting for the most part in sync with each other just doing the same crazy crazy stuff here here's another thing by the way so you meant we mentioned brazil earlier so just had a video sent to me a few days ago one of the key hospitals um there who had a lot of people sick so they that 5 000 people are positive for kovid and 200 had died of it according to the claims this hospital was overrun well the president of the of brazil is not really on board with all that's going on so some of the some of the politicians from parliament got together with the federal police and they raided this hospital broke themselves in and what did they find it's empty nobody right now this is a story we're hearing in the uk we're hearing in america and so on so these hospitals that we were originally led to believe were overflowing most of them are empty completely and utterly empty which is why maybe they've got the time to do these tick-tock dances and all the rest of it are the nurses the nurses because they've got nothing to do so we're getting this story come out of over you know terrible nobody's dying and and they're empty and then we see the stats as i mentioned earlier where 2020 you've got less chance of dying in 20 first half of 2020 than the previous five or six years um before so how is it that we got this solid message from every media across and even in brazil the media is is pushing the same stuff you've got to conclude that there's some authority above the governments there's some other authority for all the governments to be in sync with the same message and almost at the same time there's some other authority anyone who looks into this and begins to go down that path and find out what you know who are all the governments owing money to like all the richest countries in the world owe money who who too and when you start to find out follow the money is a famous thing in business right follow the money follow the money so when you start to follow the money and then you look at the the the private banks that most people think are of the countries banks like the bank of england and the federal reserve and so on and they're not the country's banks the country has to go and borrow money from them who owns those banks so who owns the bank of england so so you you end up with with 13 families headed up by the rockefellers and the rothschilds so those people have an agenda they want to control um they've tested various methods of control and the best method they've ever found of control to date they tested in russia and china is communism right under communism you can control people and governments and authorities want to control for a whole host of reasons none of them good so they've wanted to control the world population for a long time um and they are in the process of bringing in what that what's dubbed a new world order um politicians like bush and someone have talked about that use this phrase new world order they want a new system that they are in much more control than they currently are and that new system is effectively a strong version of communism so they want to get rid of capitalism that's why there's a lot of attack on on capitalism across across across the world there's a lot of attack on me right because they don't like people who are being successful so if you so if they these people they've got the money if you've got the money then you you have the ability to control you can control governments if you control the money you can control people they control the media they control the education system if you want to know what their agenda is i always say look at the education system and see what they're teaching that they never used to teach things that they've brought in in the last 50 years that we would have people would have rejected 50 years ago but they now the students are all pro look at those subjects and what you'll find is that students today are much more likely to be at least sympathetic to communism and probably they're going to be socialist at least which is pretty much there's not a lot of difference so students today in the uk and in the us and country after country are at least not anti-communism and a lot of the time they're literally pro-communism and socialism that was never the case when i was a child that's how has that happened it's being taught in the universities it's being taught in the colleges and the schools most of the teachers that teach are left socialist people how's that happen because the people who control education have pushed that agenda look at things like um that's veganism where's veganism come from okay so that again has come suddenly we've got all these vegans pushed through colleges stu universities and so on um look at you you can look after look at homosexuality wasn't accepted when i my my parents you know it was it was absolutely taboo and hot terrible to be a homosexual now i'm not arguing what's right and wrong here i'm just wanted to want to show the change so a generation ago homosexuality was bad today it's it's perfectly fine but now they've gone the next step with transgenderism and and and all the different fluid fluid gender stuff that they're now bringing in where a man if he says he's a woman is a woman and he could go to prison for calling him a woman calling him a man rather um even though he still got all his bits because he claims he's a woman all of this craziness where's it all come from it's all come through the education system through universities that they control they have an agenda they have a reason for doing that it's part of breaking down society breaking down the family it's it's all about destruction of our current system and the interesting thing is those people for instance that would say um you can't say that somebody's a man when they identify as a woman even if they look like a man and yeah they've got a beard yeah that you have to call them a woman because that's their right they are the same people that would probably push freedom of speech but then also be happy for my videos to be banned yeah it's almost like freedom of speech unless you disagree it's not freedom of speech it's orwellian it's literally 1994 coming to pass what coming to pass orwellian uh george orwell's book 1980 a little bit about that so george george orwell wrote a very famous book 1984 um where it's almost like a prophecy because everything he wrote about in that book is coming to pass um so if you haven't read that book it's a great book to read but yeah had the control taking over and the political correctness and the the freedom of speech all of that everything that's now happening and maybe there's a little bit maybe it's gone a bit further than 1984 but yeah it comes from that that book so what's the super rich the elite what's their agenda just to control everybody i don't think it's necessarily there's lots and lots of rich people very rich people that aren't part of this this is not necessarily a that money thing it's they are all the people that are trying to do this are rich yes but not all rich are part of it so we've got to be careful not just to make the super rich rule involved in this thing they're not it it's a certain group of people who control all of that and the super rich will probably end up not being super rich if they get their way if it goes the way that they're trying to do it it'll just be them so what's the what's the motivation you're saying that there's a group of people and they control the government and they control the media and the education system for what purpose okay so first of all one of the things linked to all of this is pedophilia right so we've been hearing a lot about pedophilia we've just had a big demonstration outside buckingham palace um in the last number of days um over prince andrew and the charges against him and there's a lot of pedophilia's involved so if you think what's the motivation for a pedophile you know what's the motivation for a murderer these people are nuts we can't think of them as they they'd like to hurt people they like to control people they want complete and utter control of the world's population that that there's a strong indications that they want a large part of the population dead they're trying to kill us um like a large number of us like 90 of the world's population is what it looks like they want they want to kill and that makes a lot of sense when you start if you understand what's going on in the world in terms of what they're doing with toxins and we've mentioned 5g already but we're being poisoned with there's all kinds of stuff going on which damages our our health we're i mean i'm involved that's my area health um we've got massive health problems because because they're poisoning us but they don't admit that's why we're sick so if we look at health and some of the stuff they've been doing so cancer as an example okay so most people have no clue what causes cancer because the doctors never talk about it and yet we actually know what causes cancer and they won't talk about it because they're not going to treat the cause so if you google even google at the moment you can still do this if you google carcinogenic toxins you'll get a massive list of toxins that they know cause cancer that's the definition of carcinogenic toxin so we've got all these toxins that they know cause cancer and if they if they um want to do a study on cancer they will take these toxins and inject a rat with them to give the rat cancer and then they'll do the studies on so they know how to cause cancer they know what causes cancer but you never hear it and these toxins that cause cancer they put in everything it's everywhere in our food on our clothes absolutely everywhere in the water fluoride is an example everybody knows about in our water it's a serious carcinogenic they put in our water and tell us it's good for our teeth right so why is it that our world is flooded with toxins that they know cause cat not just cancer by the way a lot of chronic diseases but they cause cancer why is that why why is that happening the only reason that's happening is because they want it to happen they know because you can you can just look it up they know it causes cancer it causes multiple sclerosis parkinson's diabetes all these diseases that in my entire life they have never found a cure for any of them i lecture sometimes to doctors and i say this i've never yet had a doctor say no you're wrong they've cured this there is no none of that none of these chronic diseases have they found a cure for in my life despite raping us for money to do research to find the cure for everything no cure and they'll never be a cure so if and if if this is totally true and factual why would why would this not be more well-known why would people go back to the control of information because they control the narrative all the information so most people don't know if you for example you went on holiday to brazil you went to the amazon jungle and you found some lost tribe who had a cure for cancer and it was a number of berries and what have you and you you tested it and everybody you gave it to was cured within within a week hypothetical probably is never going to happen but if that happened it would be illegal for you to tell anybody that do you know that there's a law to stop you is that not is that not just because though people claim things cure excuse me they they they say we don't want snake oil sales yeah because you can just say oh this cures cancer and it doesn't and then and then you're misleading people and getting profiting off of it funny because they're making claims about a vaccine not even created yet right what it's going to do right they haven't even created this vaccine but there's all kinds of claims about the about what it will do right but that's what they do though they say they say that but what so they make first of all they make it illegal and then many many scientists have proven these things all the way going back to royal life like a hundred years ago he was able to cure cancer and they trashed all his work and he spent most of the rest of his life going in and out of court they don't want a cure for cancer um that they suppress every there's loads of cures for cat my wife had cancer you know that right and six months later she didn't and she never saw a doctor after the diagnosis i'm not allowed to say she i did anything because that would be illegal but anyway six months later she didn't have cancer but they that they don't just make it illegal to make the claims they suppress this proof of these things right and then they use i think everybody knows radiation causes cancer i think everybody knows that right that's a well-known fact there's a big skull and crossbones and everything but if you go and have an x-ray the doctors run out of the room there's a reason for that everybody knows that radiation is really really bad stuff and it causes cancer and yet they use it to treat cancer most people don't know but it's the case with chemotherapy also causes cancer if you give chemotherapy to a healthy person they're very very likely they're going to get cancer is that is that not them just killing the cancer what what what what is the what is a can what is cancer that's like if you have a tree with a fungi on it right you if you cut that fungi off like surgery or you poison that fungi it's just going to keep coming back right because the tree has got that that problem right so when you cut a tumor out or you poison a bit okay let's give an analogy what it's like another better analogy actually so if you've got a flower bed and you don't look after it properly and then you end up with a lot of weeds in it it's like going and poisoning the whole flower bed yeah the weeds are gonna die yeah but so are the flowers and now you hope the flowers come back without the weeds that's what it's like you're poisoning your whole body in the attempt to poison the tumor which might work it might poison it and it might shrink for a bit or even disappear altogether but then down the road yeah see i think a lot of this stuff and you know i i'm i'm not a conspiracist but a critical thinker so i'll look at things yeah and sometimes it's crazy when people accuse you of being a conspiracy and literally all you're doing is being open-minded and looking at the side people accuse me of being a conspiracist just listening to you and having you on my channel and go that's interesting how does this work suddenly i'm a conspiracist but i think it often boils down to money because even um like the vaccines and the treatments the pharmaceutical companies i know make a lot of money i've got friends that own pharmaceutical companies and ironically they don't vaccinate their kids no they don't which is you don't hear that that blew my mind i remember and and you know when you become successful and wealthy in business like i've been very fortunate to do um you start getting invitations to different types of events and meeting different types of people and sitting on different types of tables the kind of tables that you probably wouldn't be set on if you didn't have money and you know i'm sitting with people that are very wealthy and i mean i've got friends who are billionaires they don't vaccinate their kids so it's like what do they know that i didn't know i remember just thinking if he if he owns a pharmaceutical company and he doesn't vaccinate his kids that made me start questioning things and i know you've told me um your your view on vaccinations i mean they're trying to bring in a vaccination for coronavirus which is going to change your dna permanently yeah tell me about that and do you think they'll make it compulsory they already have made it compulsory in many countries so poland for example if you don't vaccinate your children you can go to prison they want to bring that everywhere i think that it won't be from where we are now to compulsory it'll be from where we are now to um they'll start to limit you if you're not vaccinated so for example they're going to say you can't travel i'm about to fly to brazil i'm not sure if i'll be able to fly back because they're gonna they're gonna say if you're not vaccinated you can't travel if you're not vaccinated you can't go to public maybe you can't shop just like that the masks is all a test bed for vaccinations so what they're doing with maths they're going to do they're going to do with vaccinations so where they limit your freedoms if you haven't been vaccinated because you're a danger to the public so that's what they'll do i think i don't think it will be here i don't think it will be legally you have to have it off the bat they're going to build to that now get there that's where they want to go and why would you not vaccinate and you don't believe in in fact i know you've argued with my wife amanda about this well and first off one of the things that's interesting is if you're provax let's say you've got a provac doctor or provac scientist and you've got anti-vax doctors scientists and and people like myself it would be great is to have a debate and so people can see that that's the way that that's the way to know the truth and i've said this you know the the media that have come after me i've had joe lysa and these shows i'm like let's meet up let's sit down or social distance let's sit down let's have a conversation and then let's see what the result is right and they will never ever meet so they'll happily do eight videos about me make documentaries about me take tell stories to the media but they won't talk to me because they know that they are vitally wrong so when they are lying and when they are wrong they don't want debate right now i i've had debate with a few doctors and scientists and stuff the very few that will privately and rip them apart absolutely rip them apart and they know that they're not going to come off well in the debate so the fact is the anti the anti-back people that are knowledgeable uh have tried for a long time to have debates with the um top pro-vaccine people they won't do it and one of the things that you whenever you see the the lies and deception that's it always seems to follow the same sort of pattern they won't debate you get into climate change it's another one get into climate change get the pro the people that are claiming that the climate is changing and the way to solve that is by you know taxing people a lot of money to whatever get those people to debate the other side they won't do it and you see that pattern over and over and over again and as soon as you have a side that won't debate that is a big red flag that they are not being honest that or they haven't got a strong case because you would happily debate if you were wrong i'm sorry if you were if you believed in something right if you really believed in something right of course you'd happily have a conversation and say this is why i believe it and you'd have to happily have that conversation put out there and there'd be no issues are you trying to debate 40 for example to get 40 to do he won't do it none of them will do it because they will be ripped apart absolutely ripped apart so that what they rely on is they rely on ignorant people being afraid and being like sheep yeah and people turning on people see i know that if if if if you go into a uh a supermarket and you're not wearing a mask it's not a case of the police i know that the people are going to be scoffing what are you doing what you doing which is how they've they've worked that out in communism they in communism they've got the people against the people they've created that beautiful system to get people to self-police and they're bringing it in here they're bringing in self-pit policing so that people um apply peer pressure but it gets worse so down the road there'll be people like attacking and even killing people that disagree with them and the people that are on the pro side of the government narrative will get away with doing all kinds of stuff um that they shouldn't be able to do but the police will turn a blind eye when they attack beats and all of that that's already happening it's happening it's happening in america with trump look at the trump supporters getting attacked by antifa and various people and they're just getting away some sometimes i'll get one or two but mostly they get away with whatever they want burning down cities whatever they want um so so what's happening right now and what do you predict is going to happen over the coming months years well so the agenda is is to destroy the economy right which they're doing by lockdown lockdown is brilliant for just be destroying small business while at the same time the profits of companies like amazon are shooting through i think they're up 100 something ridiculous like that so the corporations are making a mint while the small businesses are all being destroyed because the government's saying you small business you have to stop your business or and when these when you start again if you're a restaurant let's say for example you're only allowed 25 percent of the customers in the the your you know your capacity of your capacity so what they're doing is making rules for our safety which totally destroy business so all these businesses are going out of business um at some point there's no way the economy can withstand what's going on at some point they will crash the pound the dollar to nothing at some point they're going to bring in a new digital currency which ultimately they're going to be able to control much more effectively because right now they're trying to get rid of cash but everyone can see that they're trying to get rid of cash because they hate cash because cash allows people to have transactions that are invisible you and i could have a transaction not i could pay you some cash the government wouldn't know about it it's an invisible transaction yeah i mean now you can't even you can't even pay cash to buy anything you go into a lot of places you can't if you go if you go shopping and you've got cash now you're going to really struggle whether it's turn their argument what's their argument their argument is cash is dirty right yeah so virus can be spread so i went into clinton cards to buy a card a couple of weeks ago right and i went to pay cash and they wouldn't accept cash they said because you know it could pass the virus which this is all the lie anyway but let's assume there is a virus in that let's assume that you can put a virus onto an object which you can then pass okay so here's my question and this kind of proves a lie of it i just touch loads of cards in the shop you pick up a card to get there not that one the next person comes in touch why why are we allowed to sell cards which we all touch and then i passed the card to the girl and but but cash why is cash being single but not the cards because it's not about touching objects that can pass a virus it's about getting rid of cats yeah because here's the thing if if if they have no control over something they don't want it right right so cash as you say you could literally if they accept if this wouldn't be a problem if that if we if cash stayed a thing if cash held its value instead of anything this wouldn't be so much of a problem because we could be free we could do what we want right but when you're completely dependent because everything's all virtual i mean it does well they're going to be able to turn that virtual thing off yeah exactly if you do close your bank doesn't like right money is stopped until you get vaccinated for example or whatever it may be do you do you wear masks no i've never worn a mask although i'm about to fly to brazil i don't know about how whether i'm going to get away with it on the part i reckon you'll get away with it knowing you i'll do my best but what how how what's the reaction like when you don't wear masks what do people say do people get offended how's it how's that okay so first off i live in north wales and in north wales it's not mandatory so in north wales it's not a problem but i come into england a lot and i shop in england and what have you so so i've done quite a bit of that and um i've personally you get you get i've never used a hand sanitizer either by the way so i i personally um most of the time just walk in and nobody says anything for the most part but you do get people coming in saying where's your mask um or you know why could you please put a mask on and the fact is that it's not a law right there's lots of reasons to not wear a mask one of the reasons that to not wear a mask that's given by the government as a is if it causes you severe distress right so if it causes you severe distress you don't have to wear a mask okay how do they test to severe distress they just have to ask you they don't know right so do you have severe distress yes i do how can they they can't test so that that's one and personally it would cause me severely stressed to have to wear a slave mask um you know do you not think that i mean listen i'm not disagreeing with you but do you think even focusing on it and worrying about something that's not yet happened right now things are kind of okay yes we're in a bit of a lockdown sort of still but focusing on the rothschilds and 5g is going to kill everybody and i mean i believe what you focus on expands you're not just going to make yourself work too miserable even thinking about this is it better to just say you know what i think life's good i think um if i was swimming in the ocean just jump off at my holiday ship i'm swimming around the ship having a having a laugh and somebody sees a shark and doesn't tell me because i don't want the negativity in my life i'd be furious right i think we've got to prepare if there's some danger we need to know about now focusing on it and you know that there's a point when it becomes negative there is a point so i'm a positive person and i do lots of positive things now but you have to be aware of danger and problems so that you can do something about it now if just nothing can be done then then it's not worth focusing on it it's only it's only worthwhile being aware when you can make a change that makes a difference yeah so presumably you think and you know i think that you can do things to prevent and to flow lots of things can be done yeah so i'm i'm i'm going to brazil so i you know if i'm reading things right when a lot of people here in the uk are pretty much shut down in their house i'll be on a beach and then you know in free you know with some maybe there might be some math stuff there isn't right now but who knows what will change so my knowledge of where it's going allows me to to make changes which will improve my situation yeah so i think for example if you know that the the um fiat currency is going to crash then when you know that that's pretty scary but there's things you can do you can get gold you can get silver you can get food so knowing about what's to come while it's a bit scary it is you know it would be crazy to think i don't want to know there are people that live their life burying their head in the sand of dangers and that's a that that carries its own dangers so because because if you're ignorant ignorant ignorance is not blessed it's not well it is until you die because you're ignorant no but even but even now though people that have been ignorant because i've been saying for years get financially literate get educated don't rely on the government because the government want you to be poor don't rely on employers i've been saying that for years yeah and now suddenly 750 000 people in the uk have been made redundant right and a lot more will and a lot more well and have lost their jobs so now people are clinging to the government yeah and the government are looking after them to a point right and i'm saying and i'm saying don't no because once they've got you that's again it's communism the government wants you to rely on them because now now you're reliant on them they pull all the strings they can tell you what to do you know like going back to the fact that they can say right we're giving you this money but you need to be vaccinated you need whatever rules they want to come up with look at communist china and find out how they live and that's where it is they don't give much anyway they'll give you just enough to live a really really poor pittance so you have a poor poor they they want you poor they want you broken they want you not fighting and and they'll give you a tiny little bit of money but then say but you can't work yeah you can't work you can't better it from there and in some cases they'll tell you what you can spend that money on um you know are those stamps for example it's like universities people say to me that universities um oh you can't compare your training program with universities because universities you get a certificate at the end of it and i'm thinking okay oh and also universities you know the government give um what you can get student loans and you don't have to really pay it back and it's years but i'm thinking no actually the people that i know that have got student debt you either do have to pay back the only time you can't you don't have to pay it back is if you're earning a pittance forever and i know people that finished you that when i went and got educated in property and learned about money and learned about how to predict things and the economy they were going to university to study philosophy yeah okay they they rack up 35 000 pounds worth of debt then can't get a job and end up in mcdonald's i end up becoming financially independent having a property portfolio um and and now they're they're still on like 20 grand a year and i'm like why don't you do this one is i can't because if i earn more than this much then i have to stop paying the money back it's like what a poor mind it's a poverty trap and i i think i what i believe is through the next few years i think that the um the poor are going to get poorer and the rich are going to get richer i think there's going to be a bigger divide i think that money is going to become worth a lot less it does anyway with inflation but i think it's going to really really crash and people that are scared and i say i don't really want to invest i don't know what to do i'll just work hard now and put money in the bank i working in vain i believe and i think now more than ever is the time to get in is to get financially independent but also to get smart the reason i like property is because it's very very difficult for anyone to take a property off you and ultimately you've always got to live somewhere and there's nothing that comes without risk you know they can steal gold everything's got everything does come with an element of risk but it but but it's about how can i financially make decisions now which are going to de-risk and minimize how can i give myself the best opportunity to get through a potential great depression so what kind of things are you doing apart from moving to brazil which is which is which is great because you think that you're gonna have more freedom there yeah i know you're also uh you're in business yeah you're you're investing in gold um i know you're looking also doing some development in brazil and buying some land and different things like that what's what why do you think it's important to be an entrepreneur because you think that it is absolutely critical it's more critical now than ever because you cannot if you're dependent on the government you just have to look at history at any group of people depending on the government how does it work out in america look at the look at the um native american indians yeah look at the poverty that they're in by trusting the government who gave them some land and gave them some money and totally destroyed them as a society and again look at going to communist countries and china and russia but even some of the european countries like romania just look at what they've done there you do not ever want to be dependent on the government and one of the differences between the way that i and you think on the on the entrepreneur in general thinks compared to the average person is that we don't trust the government to look after our best interests no we don't we don't so we want to look after ourselves and that brings with it some challenges but it brings freedom and we do a lot better when we're doing that so we want minimal government um and whereas whereas people that you know trust to go they want they want the government to have more and more power and so that that's a big difference between the capitalist mentality and the socialist communist mentality so um so yeah there's things that i'm doing so let's let's look at kind of doomsday situation where let's say the money crashes to nothing or even even in the uk now i i i've been predicting for uh for a while now so one of the things that's going to happen is we're going to have food shortages we're going to have serious food shortages um we've already tasted that a little bit when the stores didn't have stuff that we used were used to it having and some of the things that disappeared real fast were the things that you need like rice um which uh uh and pasta just disappeared immediately i don't know if that happened here but in wales no it happened everywhere right and that's i think that's one of the reasons why we now have a um our own crops right and a b day yeah what's that and a b day no that's why we've got we you know we we we have we can grow our own food that's one of those so one of the big things listen if if it all goes to hell and you're in lockdown you're staying in your house really you don't need many things to survive you need shelter and you need food and water right so but so they're going to make it so that the food certainly you're going to have trouble getting okay so oh in leicester they had a lock down to those apartments they couldn't go out and get food so they what in that situation there was food but they weren't allowed to go and get it so they're relying on the government to provide and i don't know if you saw the food that they're getting it was prison food it was even worse than prison food it was it was horrible so i don't want to be relying on the government for my food um so the first thing you need to do is make sure that you've got good supplies of food with a good um shelf life so things like rice is going to be great things like pasta and tins i don't normally eat tins um tin food but but this is a situation where tin food is going to be helpful to get because it lasts forever almost so tin food right that that kind of stuff now i also i use certain certain supplements so i have a supplement a green supplement which is made up of 44 superfoods and it's got all the vitamins and all the minerals and one little scoop is the equivalent of 33 servings of fruit and veggies so i've got that it'll put that on my rice my rice will fill me that will give me all the vitamins and all the mints like 60 odd minerals and it gives me enzymes and probiotics and stuff so that that that's to get the nutrition because you're not going to be able to get fresh fruit and veg and stuff um so the rice will fill me and that will give me the nutrients that so getting food is a big big deal yeah um so you stuck up stock up and listen as well this this is so dooms and gloom and it can sound like almost like poverty mindset of saying like oh you know buy loads of rice and pasta and it sounds a little bit um like you're focusing on the pennies if you're not focusing on the pennies what you're doing is you just you you've got it's money in the bank right so it just means money it's not even costing you anything because you're going to spend all that money on food anyway and i and food's gonna go up in price yeah so it's an investment and it's also it's also a precaution one of the ways that you kind of know that you're gonna need that is that one of the narratives they've started putting out over during this thing is they've started calling people who prepare by getting food nasty selfish orders like that's the sort of so they're trying to get people in in their head to think that if you stock up on food in anticipation of a famine your nasty selfish order that tells me that that's that's one of the ones because if there was plenty and it was all good what's the problem what where is where is the problem with stocking up on food when it's quite likely going to be a food shortage and there's lots of things they're doing to the food industry especially animal food you're going to find that the factories that do animal food are the ones that get loads of covered cases and have to shut down yeah you see that all over the world the meat factories so food is one thing next is investments so i mean you know i'm i'm a big investor myself and you've got to have a way of creating income yeah that's not reliant on your job i like property i know you like gold the reason i like property is because number one it's very difficult to steal listen i think you should be doing multiple different things that you don't want eggs in one basket on this because we don't know what's going to happen another great thing about property and i've got land in other countries as well right but not not no i don't talk about too much and it's very cheap i know it doesn't it doesn't grow my net worth massively but it's just good to have yeah you know just little little bits of bombs because you just you know what there's a lot of you you can buy land in in africa for absolute pittance yeah you can and africa is a developing country so if it's if it's developing that means that it probably will be developed one day so that land will probably one day be worth a hundred times as much yeah it's just a good investment it's a good investment brazil too brazil too yeah and and i know you like that you like me having lots of houses isn't that smart probably because you can sometimes live in them yourself as well you you phone me up and you're like hey i mean because you travel you move around a lot i've lived in four countries in the last six years right so you've lived in brazil you've lived in greece you've lived in tenerife yeah whatever yeah and you moved often for a year or so i remember you called me up and you said i'm you know i'm in greece yeah i want to move back to the uk have you got any houses and you've been staying at one of my lovely houses as well yeah how's the house been yeah well i live i was living in a absolutely for those that know near coed in north wales stunning stunning area fantastic and one of one of the things i always think like people go on holiday to various places that are beautiful and they go for two weeks um and then they go back to them you know to warsaw or whatever and i just think why don't you just live in these beautiful places yeah why do you live in a rubbishy place and then holiday to them just go and live um we're not we're not trees we can move so so i always just go somewhere beautiful and so that is a has been i've lived there for the longer longest time of any recent movie it's two years i've lived there now yeah um i'm glad the house has worked out for you despite it being a really good holiday let property yeah but you you know i'd rather you be in there and and when i moved it took me one conversation to have somebody say from brazil come over and they want it now they want it yeah it's a good it's a good and it was actually a house that i bought with no money that wasn't no money those are the best houses yeah you can buy a house without using any money yeah um so yeah so invest and i think gold why why are you buying gold at the moment because that's well first of all why the banks buying gold if they're buying gold that's a little clue that they you know because they know what's going on and the price of gold is so the thing about the thing about gold is that historically it's always held its value yeah so right now gold is money right so um and fear is is is imaginary money um so right now if you've got fear it just seems to me that fear is going to become less valuable even in normal circumstances it's going to become less valuable but in these circumstances it's going to drop to the floor so if you've got fear you need to put it in something that's not going to drop one of those one of the best historical things for that has been gold silver is another one property probably can go down as you i'm not even going to talk about property because that's your expert area so i don't want to go but the thing about property that i like is that it gives you an income as well it does it holds its value often goes up and it gives you an income yeah i appreciate the goal i mean robert a lot of the stuff that you say is actually very much in line with robert kiyosaki right and he's he's been quite outspoken about the whole pandemic he calls it the pandemic and he talks about gold and the investments rich dad poor dud if anyone doesn't know who he is he's also a real estate investor um but he's not afraid to say in fact a lot of rich people think what you're saying exactly right and and regular people the problem is they just get all that information from the mainstream media and even when you teach them something you say something they're like where's your source and if the source isn't mainstream media they don't want to know well then they can never burst out of that bubble because if you think that only what mainstream media is saying is true then you're lost effectively what is it about because because the thing is with education i say that the education system's warped that's one of the reasons why i teach what i have you know as my dad i never intended to be a teacher i intended to be a property investor it was only five years after being a successful property investor when i thought actually i'm going to pass this on the reason i'm doing this youtube video i'm not going to be popular for doing this youtube video at all no i'll be hated the media will hate me even more the government and the system will hate me even more than they already seem to do at the moment i'm doing this out of the duty of responsibility because i know that there's things going on you've told me certain stuff that i thought that's interesting that's helpful and i've prepared so for me to then not pass that message on and i'm not telling people what to believe i'm not saying to people everything that you say is true and you know i'm just saying think you know just just be a critical thinker the education system i think is completely warped i don't blame the teachers it's not the teacher's fault because all the teachers do is they they follow a curriculum all the good teachers leave well i don't know if that's a bit unfair i think that maybe maybe some do many many you can be a really good teacher a school teacher and you can you can you know be brilliant with a good heart but still you can only really teach the curriculum and the curriculum you could you could apply that across other industries the police is the same you can have you know but it is but the curriculum who who decides what can and cannot be in the curriculum well the government well this brings us back to one of the organizations which is pushing this whole um covered thing which is world health organization so the world health organization have pushed in the education system they've got a lot of power and so in the uk right now they've just got it through that are they're going to start teaching and i might get the age slightly wrong but they're going to start teaching four or five years or something like masturbation as an example that is to my mind is absolutely sick perverted crazy i would never want my child hopefully any good parent wouldn't want their child but who have managed to push that through these organizations that are basically running things with kovid and with a lot of other areas they are sick sick sick people so so you ask the question who is doing that and you find who look behind who who ate who let's let's say say that to make it clearer and you find you end up getting back to the rocket fellas and the rothschilds you've got bill gates heading heading up um that bill gates who wants less less population but is pushing vaccines how's you know how do you know bill gates because he stated it many of them have stated it has stated that he wants less population he says that we he says he did a ted talk um he's done it lots of times but he stated that the the the way that we're growing as a population which by the way also isn't true we're we're nowhere near in a problem with population levels um anyway that's a whole other subject but bill gates and many of these top influential people many of them have a belief that we have too many people and that we need to get them down um and they're doing various things they're the same people that are preaching vaccinations right which again doesn't make much sense a critical thinker can look at that and say okay there needs to be some questions answered here and that's what critical thinking is so and then when you find out in africa for example many of the women who've been vaccinated end up sterile and they're putting things in the vaccines that sterilize you what do you think about this new corona vaccine what's it going to do it's going to do horrible horrible things first of all however you want to look at it even if you're pro-vaccine i know a lot of pro-vaccine doctors who won't take this new one and one of the reasons is because they have not possibly had enough time to do the studies to to know that it's safe for the record they've never done safety studies on any vaccines that are any good so um but but there's not even the illusion that they've done it here so um so there's no there's no real studies done on safety but this is a new vaccine that that with a completely new technology where they're actually going to be changing your dna now that you're basically going to become a if people understand about gmo crops where they genetically modify the plants they're basically moving down the path now gmo people you're going to become a gmo person after this vaccine right who knows what that will do but even based on the earlier vaccines if you actually have done the research vaccines do a tremendous amount of damage to our health they are not good at all none of them this one is going to be the worst ever however it might be that the first ones that come out will be toned down versions because if they start injecting people and they drop dead no one's gonna take it so they so what they say about vaccinations though is that you're just so if you're vaccinating say corona vaccine you i'm alright i'm thinking that they're just gonna give you a little bit of corona not enough to kill you and then no it's not this one no no no this one they're going to change your dna so that to try and get yourself to produce certain things to fight it well by the way they're fighting they're fighting a virus that doesn't exist that's just the virus doesn't exist they've got to prove the virus exists first and after they prove it exists then they've got to prove that it causes covid 19. they've done neither of those things what is covered 19 well covered in 19 is just is the disease that they keep changing what it is um so it started with a handful of symptoms that they said that's covered and then they just keep adding things to it um is it a disease or is it a virus well well it doesn't copy doesn't exist if they find some fragments of the rna or dna in you they say that that's that therefore you've now got this disease but it doesn't exist i've just made it up it's a made-up disease and that's why you can be shot and and they say it's coveted it's what they've just made it up and you have had conversations with doctors many doctors and and what are they saying well the doctors that i mostly um work with um understand what's going on and they know it's all fake how can doctors have the wall paul appalled if it's that fake how can intelligent when your income relies on you not knowing something how do you mean if if they know it they lose their income yeah but surely you can't say all doctors know and they're just pretending okay we had i'm sure you saw this because this one broke through we had a bunch of doctors who got together and made a video about a month ago maybe two months ago now um where they challenged the narrative and said it wasn't true basically i think you saw that video i think a lot of people saw that video what happened what was those doctors have all been smashed in the media right i suspect i one of them lost their job in the first week right i suspect all of them will be losing their jobs i don't know what because again it's hard to find out because they control the narrative it's not easy to find out but those doctors will never ever go up the ladder minimum if they even hold their job at all so that's how so if you're a doctor and but if you become a doctor you usually get into huge debt to become a doctor um so if you know that if you speak you're going to lose your job or at least not go up the ladder you're going to be attacked and thought of as a kook as a quack and all the rest of it they're going to they're going to go through do what they've done to you go through everything in your life and try and find things to bring you down who wants to go through that well i've been through it you you have but you wouldn't choose it right you know so they made me better and they didn't find much and i would be a person that would stand and i know you would but doctors the typical doctor mentality that they're not people that like to stand out um that the type of person that becomes a doctor typically there are some though there's you know there's a bunch of them and then another thing that happened so to the doctor so i don't know if i want to go into these topics but so a doctor um discovered that there was something being put in vaccines which did immense damage okay uh dr jeff bradstreet was his name so he discovered that there was something being put in vaccines that that caused all kinds of problems and he he developed um a solution an antidote let's say for that and he but he couldn't say anything so he was just doing it privately with his own people and he told a few of his colleagues that he knew was safe okay so it got discovered the fda broke into his office smashed it all up took all his stuff three days later he committed suicide with a shotgun in the back of his head and was found in a lake over the next 12 months 52 other doctors were all suicided you know all died and actually jeff bradstein ended up officially being a murderer it was suicide for a while but they ended up being officially emerged so 50 50 odd doctors over 12 months all dead all involved in this it's a risky business because this is a serious game you know so um it's not easy to stand up it's not and so i don't blame you well i started getting attacked in the media and listen i can't i can't prove or say that there's a correlation but when i started doing videos on help to buy schemes and saying look this is this isn't this is not legitimate this is the government's plan here these help to buy isis are a scam here's how to invest smart hazel right you know not trying to sell a product not trying to just literally educate people on youtube suddenly bang bbc do a show on may yeah the media come after me i have a i have a witch hunt and people are too stupid to be critical thinkers because people just think oh a bad headline from they don't even read the story see when you read the media stories it's all i've seen it even with covered 19 it says this person died and had symptoms of covered 19. does that actually say this person died of covered 90s because they can't say that but what they what they do is they phrase it such a way it looks like they're saying that you know and and the media well here's what they're doing right now here's one of the changes that they've done right now so at the beginning um they were that people were dying and and a lot of the deaths by the way were were through the coving regulations a lot a lot of the death for care homes and they were just really abused those people they were with they had all medication withdrawal i had personal experience where i had serious um toothache and i couldn't see a dentist for three months so there's a lot of people suffered because of coving regulations where you couldn't get help that people generally needed anyway a lot of people died and at the beginning they were saying this many people have died today this many any constant numbers of deaths to bring up fear right right they aren't doing that anymore have you noticed that they're not doing that well now they've changed it because nobody's dying but they want to keep the fear going so because nobody's dying now what they're doing is they're talking about number of cases this is people tested positive with their stupid test so we've discussed the test being useless but the other way of getting higher positives which they're doing you just do more tests so if you do a million tests you're going to get a lot more than if you do donald trump got really badly ridiculed for saying that he said that the reason there was more cases in america than other countries was because they were doing more testings and he did get ridiculed but logically just think about it if you test 100 people and ten percent a positive and you want more numbers if you detest a thousand people and ten percent are positive you've got a much bigger number so why did donald trump get ridiculed for that because the mainstream media is it's their narrative why did he get ridiculed for suggesting um hydroxychloroquine why because i'm not a fan of it but it does it is it does work um it's not as i'd go with natural things but it does work what it's proved to work hydroxychloroquine was proved in 2015 to work on stars cov1 and 40 stated that and now we've got solskov 2 and it's like don't use it it's a terrible drug it's been out 75 years it's used without prescription across half the world the media aren't talking about the protests either like was it was it yesterday when there was and i've seen it on tick tock because tick tock's one of the few platforms that they can't control right because the chinese they're trying desperately too he's behind trying to control that but i mean i mean youtube facebook it's not owned by the same people yeah owned by the same people google and you think i'll just google it but actually there's google control what you say yeah so tick tock is a little bit different because owned by the chinese and i'm seeing stuff on tick tock and i'm shocked i'm seeing that there's happening here in this country yeah just 30 minutes away from my house tens of thousands of people protesting in manchester yeah i don't know how many because it's not reported i've got friends that were there there was a there was a few thousand right just the other day yeah a few thousand people who manchester protesting and it wasn't even mentioned in any of them of the media which tells you if you're a critical thinker they've got an agenda because why would they not say that that's big news thousands and thousands of people demonstrating outside buckingham palace calling prince andrew a pedophile that's news right why is it not on there what and but it's not happening just in the uk that's across the world all these demonstrations they had huge demonstrations in berlin i i understand it was over a million not in the media so if they're not reporting it then that that's got to tell you that they have an agenda and they don't want you knowing that because it conflicts with their agenda and again though it goes back to the whole point of the teachers at the schools they're just following their curriculum right the people that are journalists in the media i don't think they're all part of it they're just no they they want to do the stories very often but that the stories aren't allowed to be printed or or posted so it's not it's not the journalist in particular there will be some but there are journalists who want to be proper journalists but they can't it's all controlled from the top so the average person then um just to sort of you know give advice i mean my biggest advice to the average person watching this is whether they agree whether they disagree whether they agree with some but would be to just be a critical thinker and to think and resurrect stuff and when you say research that's challenging because don't use google you can't research with goo if you're going to use a search engine at least use duckduckgo at least it's a lot better than google it's still controlled but much less i've never heard of that right yeah so don't go and there's there's other search engines there's a russian one and there's various ones but that's pretty hard though to tell people to research but don't use google we google's completely and utterly controlled google you know that you're not gonna get any of the information that would come to the the um the what we're talking about brian rose has set up a really good platform has no freedom platform.tv right yeah have you seen that i don't know if i have but there's this he's been attacked by the media right again surprise surprise you know the media always loved brian rose before from london real no problems and then the second he speaks out against their narrative but his went down in the middle of a his youtube videos went down he got d platform but he he he went down i think in the middle of speaking yeah yeah and then after that the media did a whole massive article that they're currently doing a witch hunt on him now desperately trying to uh ruin his reputation discredit him yeah and if you read it though it's the same story because i've had it on me i'll read it and say allegedly yeah and it says you know some of his students as well have been reported to not be happy hold on a minute how many students does he have and what's the percentage of happy birthday and i don't care about that i'm just interested in what he's reported what they're trying to do they're trying to discredit him to make him look like a bad person so that then you think oh or therefore what he says well they did this with dr wakefield so dr wakefield was a welsh doctor who um questioned uh he linked or showed there was a correlation between vaccines and certain health issues and he just said look there seems to be a correlation that needs further looking he was pro-vaccine pretty much but he said that anyway he ended up being absolutely hammered um but by by his own um his own doctor bodies and what have you and the media and still today when i when i mentioned dr wakefield even though it's now been proven false the allegations against him when uh when i mention him people say oh he's a quack he's just that's what they did it's the same as when the people said when they published stories about me saying oh samuel uh lied about lord sugar and all this and then when i put the evidence out there they then oh yeah they edit the story on the 37th page there's no big headlines anymore there's not like samuel was right after all actually and forever you'll have people believing that you lied about about lord sugar even though i've proven it even though you've proven it forever have people believe that my students are unhappy even though that of course there's not everybody but the vast majority yeah and the stories and they all they also they they'll say someone once said or from one source it was said it's like you could stop a random dude in the street and just make it up all together or just make it but the thing is though if if a random person who's got no credentials is an absolute nobody says brian rose is a liar yeah one source has reported that brian rose is a lie hold on a minute one source allegedly what does that mean that means there's no evidence whatsoever there's no proof but someone said it therefore we can say it but people don't people don't see the word allegedly allegedly brian rose and they read that oh brahmos did that no no he allegedly did it but he didn't do it there's no evidence yeah so whenever i now had evidence but now when i read news stories though i just see was like allegedly someone said from one source it's being said and i just ignore the whole rest of the sentence and it's clear there's an agenda when you get attacked you start to understand their tactics much better yeah how they are bbc won't meet with me yeah channel four joe joe lysa but but they're all pawns joe lysett doesn't have an issue with me i'm sure yeah he was just reading his script even lord sugar was reading a script you can see it's it's all scripted yeah it's all manufactured scripted with an agenda with a narrative and people say you know oh you're just saying this because like look i don't have to say this i don't have to be doing this this video whoever controls the narrative controls all that and they want to control the information and they why are people so stupid because the education system educates them to accept authority rather than question authority they they educate critical thinking out of you um so i i understood this when i was in i left school like like you which i all my kids i left at 16. i didn't want to stay in the education system because i knew i knew it it was rubbish and one of the things that they do what a big thing that they do is get you to accept authority and unquestionably and just repeat facts as taught to you by authority without questioning those facts so people come up like that so if if i state something on health a large percent of the population will be what does the doctor say i'm going to check that with my doctor i'm talking on nutrition now i'm trained in nutrition the doctors aren't but people are trying go and ask your your doctor the doctor doesn't have a clue not a clue he's had no training maybe maybe he's had four hours training or something whereas i'm i've been in the industry years and years and years and fully trained but they still have a mindset check with the doctor about something he's not trained because they're that's what we're taught but successful people don't do that successful people don't rely on the government they don't listen to the media no they don't read the sun news but the scottish sun yeah they even listen to their dad right you question right you don't believe stuff i tell you that's because i'm a critical thinker you tell me something i'll say okay thank you very much right i'll go and research it now i taught you to be a critical thinker and it was quite annoying as a debt when you've got kids questioning you and you just want to say that's it but i allowed that and i encouraged that because i wanted you and russell and what have you to be critical thinkers and that's really really important really and i don't want my audience to blindly listen to me no i want them to look at the facts yeah look at look at the facts do your research and then so take the take the math thing just a little bit of critical thinking find out how big the hole in the mask is and how big the virus is supposed to be and then and then think about it when you when you know those two facts you're just going to see how stupid it is the masks don't work no and the they don't they they don't even care it's not about safety it's about obedience worse than they don't work they actually damage your health right so it's worse they don't work like the virus is vastly smaller than the holes in the in the thing they just go straight you can wear a mask though that has massive gaping gap okay not covering your nose lots of holes in there and they're happy because oh well you're obedient yeah so what they're doing is that they're trying to make us obedient yeah um which is which is worrying and i'm not critically think hang on a minute if the virus they claim that causes is this size and the hole is this size you know just think it there is a level though i mean sometimes i don't believe it or not i don't like to be offensive i don't like to upset people um there are times like yesterday um i went into an environment whereby i did wear a mask because i just thought i know people are going to be ticked off i i just don't want to offend people that i'm around um because because that it's not their fault that they believe what they believe so i don't know do you know no i'm offended that you wore a mask so now you've offended me yeah i don't i think we've got to fight this i think we've got to fight it with everything because the mask is basically a marketing campaign for the vaccine and the more successful they are with the mask and mandating a completely useless piece of cloth over your face that i just saw um a few a few weeks ago the advice from the government on if you find somebody collapsed you know where whereas you might give mouth to mouth and do all this stuff now the first thing you do is throw a cloth over their face it's like what so they're struggling to breathe and you throw a cloth it's crazy but they want you to just accept all this stuff without critically thinking we gotta fight this we gotta fight it every point so i've never worn a mask other than the flight i hope i'll never wear a mask again and maybe not wear it on the flight depending but no no this is a fight and we we need to fight it because if we accept that for whatever reason to offend people to annoy people to get a fine whatever it might be we get to wear a mask then we're one step closer to accepting all the things that they want i tell you it's very interesting though most people i'll meet someone i'll do a viewing or i'll have me be meeting someone for business and i obviously at this time in in where we are so we're now in august i won't go in for a handshake because of social distancing i'll keep my distance and so will they yeah so we're both distanced and we're both doing you know being respectful but then i'll find out that they think it's a whole scam anyway i find out because i put my hand at it yeah i know you do so so i'm thinking for the last 20 minutes i've been social distancing i've not been touching my heart i've been following the rules so have you yet both of us think it's stupid yeah which is crazy like i put this video out with robert kiyosaki grant cardone and uh and others with their view on this pandemic and corona basically all saying the same thing which is that it's wealthy redistribution it's a government agenda and i put this video out and i was thinking you know what the reaction's gonna be really bad i want to offend people but um whatever because you're you're mostly talking to ultimate entrepreneurial minds but that's my point though most people that when you actually speak to them don't think that i wouldn't say most people in your circle most people i think it's probably not as good a percentage as you'd like to think there's a lot of people that are totally accepting it all but i think most people though okay maybe not most people there's a lot of people there's a lot of people that believe that this is all a government agenda and it's a planned emmy yeah they believe that but they just don't say it yeah see i'm one of the few people apart from brian rose respect to him and robert kiyosaki and those others but most people that have a little bit of a platform um they won't say it and this is the thing i've learned as well most people that have a platform that they're so bothered about being liked and they're so bothered about being popular reviews and thinking about branding deals and they're thinking about how is this going to affect my sponsors and my my youtube i don't have any sponsors i don't they can youtube can demonetize my whole channel i don't care yeah because i don't the the government can lock down my i'm good i'm okay i'm financially independent and i'm doing what i'm doing from a position of mission and purpose but actually there's so many people i think it's the the silent majority that and then you've got the the very very loud minority right i don't know what percentages i do know that when i'm out and about and i get chatting to people it's quite a lot of people that are aware that this it's not right they might not know to the level i do but they know that things are not right and there's something fishy about it as a minimum so a lot of people like that and then you get the people driving driving in a face mask in their car on their own and you're just like you know it's like crazy they were sitting in their garden with a mask on yeah yeah i i i've seen them in in pictures not in real life i've seen them in real life in cars but in pictures i've seen them in the ocean wearing a face mask it's like everybody has to make their own decisions everybody has to do what they feel is safe i believe that the way that people should be safe is by studying becoming financially independent that's keeping safe yeah so i want people to stay safe but not in the way the government probably tell you to stay safe i want people to educate themselves to think to become financially literate to to get some income to get some passive income to have some good investments that's my agenda that's what i want that's why i did this video what would you be your final kind of piece of advice and and thoughts and just before you move to brazil because i'm not going to see you in a very long time it could be an extremely long time if they ban flights and stuff um but what would be your what do you really want how do you want people to react to this to this video well what i don't want is people to be in fear that's what the government wants the government want that the government want that because fear allows people will do things they would never do they'll submit to things they'd never submit to through fear so if they can keep a population in fear they can do a lot of things so we don't want to be in fear um so so it's a very contrary message to what the government puts out so the first thing is not to be in fear the second thing is though but we but not to go the other way where we bury our heads to not be in fear we need to be aware and educated on what's going on so that we can take actions to best protect ourselves our family our loved ones and so on um so and we need to learn how to research and really you need to start looking i mentioned already using a different um a different search engine youtube is getting less and less good stuff on there in terms of this kind of topic it's almost non-existent on youtube so there are other platforms like bitshit you mentioned brian rose he's got a good platform that's that he's created so that he can put this stuff out so bitshoot.com is a kind of a youtube it's not as good as youtube in many respects but in respect of having information that you can't get it's it's it's really really good so there's lots of good information on on bitchu so understand that we're going to go into a a period where if you've got a job you're likely to lose it if if um you're like the the fiat currency is likely to collapse so you need to find some way of being self-sufficient in every way you can whether that's financial growing your own food everything that you can do to be self-sufficient and not rely on government or anybody else um if and the government of course don't want us being self-sufficient they've always been against self-sufficiency and that's all about control in the states you know there's a lot of land that you could live off grid they don't want you living off grid they want you tapped into the electricity and all those to it for control so we want to be doing the opposite of that we want to be finding self-sufficiency so make sure you got enough food um i'm a big believer in supplements but most ninety percent of supplements are really unhealthy as well that's all take let's go to holland and barrett holland and barrett is owned by big pharma nearly all bad so you gotta you gotta know what you're looking for um so so it all boils down really to critical thinking and self-sufficiency be as self-sufficient as you can if you've got a garden and you're not growing food right now start you know look at ways of getting water and yeah just just be as self-sufficient as you possibly can if you can move then i think moving from the uk to some of the african countries there's lots of countries that are not going to be having the same problems that we have so if you can move do that that's even even better you can always come back if it doesn't pan out the way i'm saying but moving is is uh well listen i mean i i have decided not to move yeah and we could argue about that in your situation it would be very difficult and not only i mean i could move i know i've got a family but they're not in school and stuff i could very easily move but i still see massive opportunity in the uk yeah um i've also got a mission here in the uk however i agree with a lot of what you've said and i'm glad that you've taken the time to come out and i know you don't get anything from from doing this and i wish you a safe masked flight to brazil hopefully but we'll find out and honestly respect and and thanks thanks for coming on and thanks for your input you've had on my life uh for raising me and for helping me become an entrepreneur and i wish you all the very best in brazil thank you very much [Music] i'm excited we're going to be on the beach we're going to have a fantastic house beautiful area and we're not going to be in lockdown [Music] um i'll see you real soon i'll see you soon have a safe trip i love you see you soon love you lots see ya bye so that's it my dad's gone due to the government restrictions in the uk he's like in case we have another lock down forget that i'm out a fair play i'll miss him ,3
au_yPDswtdk,hey what's up my name's samuel leeds hey officer leeds and we are going to be discussing the help to buy scheme and how it has screwed over a lot of buyers and first-time buyers i'm frankly really upset about it about what's happening russell on the other hand doesn't agree with me and russell thinks that the help to buy scheme is a great scheme that helps people out i actually think you're joking i can't believe you're even serious in saying that absolute nonsense um okay you want me to back it up now exactly believe that the help to buy scheme helps buyers and is a nice good scheme i'm in the health bar scheme um listen i think it's an amazing scheme i'm not saying the help to buy scheme is brilliant what it is what it is is this a sham um come on explain why it's a sham okay and then i'll tell you why you're wrong okay you know what they say they say uh audacity doesn't cost anything and listen the help to buy scheme as you know as a developer is actually help to sell it's not help to buy it's very very much helped to sell i agree with that yeah so calling it help to buy scheme is misleading because you can't quite help they couldn't call it help to sell scheme could that they couldn't say this is the because it's got to appeal to to the to the bias all of the schemes from there as well all of the schemes yeah all of these schemes um even student loans whether what the government want you to do is they want you to go to university be a good boy good girl they want you to get a a degree they want you then save up money put it in the bank they want you to then buy your first home they want you to buy a stupid overpriced new build home from a rich developer they want the rich to get richer and the poor to get poorer they want you to look forward to your pension and die broke that's the system and it annoys me when i see people falling for it and i think as working class people ourselves we grew up with very little i think that i can't believe that you as someone that benefits from the help to buy a scheme as a developer as someone that benefits you're you're the rich person hiding away you're the rich person you're the rich person that that's saying oh no i think it's great and if i'm honest bro i honestly believe the reason you think it's great is because you financially benefit from it and you've seen my youtube videos you've seen what my youtube videos are about we are of the same heart we run a training company together but it just shocked me when i heard you say when and it was a result of this article which i'm going to read in a minute all right cool right here's the thing right and the government have got their own agenda yeah so whatever whatever it might be so for example they've got an agenda that they want us to drive electric cars yeah so as a result they make it very beneficial for tax reasons et cetera et cetera for you to drive an electric car they've got an agenda that they want you to do that you know like uh robert kiyosaki says doesn't he they don't want you to pay those attacks they actually they set it up so that if you do what they want you get tax breaks yeah so that's why the rich get richer and the poor get poorer because the the taxes are for the poor and middle class yeah yeah i agree yeah right so whatever their agenda is in this case i think they've got an agenda with the help to buy a scheme of they want more homes in the uk yeah so they've thought imagine you were the government now and you're thinking okay i want more more home more houses built in the uk how do i do that well the first thing i need to do is i need to get developers to build more houses so i'm going to create a scheme that just ticks two boxes right the first thing that it takes is it makes it um financially viable for developers to build more houses and be able to sell them and get a good profit because you know you know like a lot of deals that you fight it's sometimes hard to find a deal where you're going to make a lot of profit out of it with house prices and et cetera if you're finding land sometimes you can find very profitable deals but often you'll find a plot of land it's like oh that doesn't stack up right it's not viable so they want more houses they need to make it stack up so they've come up with a really good scheme i think that does two things number one it makes it very beneficial for developers but number two it allows people who otherwise wouldn't be able to get on the housing ladder it allows them to pay a five percent um deposit now i'm not saying it's the best scheme in the world but when you compare it to not buying anything and just renting and then you were saying yeah i've got friend people i went to school with um who have used the hell to buy a scheme and if it wasn't for that they'd be renting so i don't think it's a bad deal for them it's not brilliant it's not ideal uh i don't think it's the an amazing scheme yeah but i don't think it's i don't think it's the devil like you seem to think it is i think that's more where i'm coming from i understand that here's my massive problem with it don't understand what you're saying my massive problem with it is that they're trying as you just said to help developers yeah build more homes make more money but instead of instead of saying that instead of maybe giving the developers a tax break or instead of maybe putting some money towards their build costs or whatever or helping the builders what they're doing is they're they're taking the money from the poor people well they're not taking money from them but what they're doing is they're relying on them their ignorance so they're taking people that don't know what they're doing and they're saying hey we'll give you some money we'll help you by yourself but what's the alternative the alternative is what would they do if it wasn't for the government what would happen let's say the help to buy scheme didn't exist what do you think these people that use it would do instead i don't know but what i do know is that they are often uneducated people and they don't know much about investments and they're told we're gonna help you buy a house but then they're told oh but you've got to live in the house you can't rent it out it has to be a new build and when you buy a new build house it drops in value straight away so now they're in a lot of them with negative effects it's these types of articles bro that just that just freaked me out and i just feel so bad for them let me let me read this okay this was literally published uh this month october the 8th uh by the mirror and of course you can't read the media you can't listen to the media so we're gonna have to make our our own conclusions after reading the media first time buyers discover their three bed new build property is worth absolutely nothing chris and steph oliver bought their home for 130 000 pounds in 2014 with a 20 help to buy loan however last year they discovered huge unfinished problems with the development new build homes have come under the spotlight in recent years with developers accused of cutting corners and inflating prices to cash in on those using the help to buy scheme so again there's so many people that again that are getting suckered in by this and the and the government you might say well that's the developers that's not the government but the government are enabling them you haven't explained why the house is now worth nothing so carry on okay we've heard from the buyers who've been left trapped in unsellable homes whilst others say they're locked in punishing leasehold clauses oh that is bad that's terrible yeah the lease that's not the help to buy scheme what's happening is developers are flogging their crappy houses their shiny crappy houses onto poor first-time buyers and the government are going yeah we'll help you that house ticks the box 95 of houses don't ticks the box but that has ticks the box they'll be like me having my kids right and the thing is the people look to the government as like a parent yeah do they though the government is a parent i don't think so people people look to the government for benefits for help for support they get they get student loans backed by the government they they go into the people taking advantage of the government when they can no people rely on the government yeah of course of course they i'm not saying they don't really like what i'm saying on my videos and on my channel as i'm saying hey don't rely on the government think and look at what they're doing and you see that these schemes are not to help you despite having the words help to buy for help the buyers it's not to help the buyers what to turn your phone on silent bro i mean just just when i couldn't be more irritated with you right now your phone's pinging right so it's like it's knocked out so so so this these people okay these people are buying houses and now they're worth nothing and they were backed by the government not now yeah but but why is it worth nothing you haven't said why it's worth nothing no it's worth nothing there's many cases so in this case one of the main issues so one of the main is probably loads is that the aesthetic backs onto a former landfill site okay so this isn't anything to do with methane gas this is to do with the the the it shouldn't have been soldered that they use the hell that's like saying oh it's a mortgage company they use the wrong mortgage basically what you're saying new builds always drop in value straight when you buy a new boat it's like buying a car when you drive it off it drops okay well let's talk about that let's talk about this example it's got nothing to do with that dubai scheme it's about the landfill this is obviously an extreme example yeah that's a different thing that i that's terrible what's your point okay my point is that is obviously terrible yeah nobody should have helped to buy that that's to do with whoever stopped the mortgage company or whoever signed that off because help to buy is only for brand new builds what are you saying that we shouldn't be able to buy new build houses i'm saying to encourage somebody to buy a brand new house listen no no no no let's listen a sec to encourage someone to buy a brand new house to live in is stupid it's not if it is maybe for that person if they're they're well it depends on what they want what they want right if it's either that or renting and not buying what would you what would you rather here's a question for you what do you think's better so let's say let's say um chels for example yeah would it be better for her help to buy so she owns yeah or renting i'd i'd rent and not buying anything yeah i'd rent because she's still gonna put five percent a little bit of money yeah it's like what five i was great i never get trapped into a house where i've got a load of mortgage debt and debt to the government buying a new build housing in the long run though in the long run you'd look back and you'd go oh i'm actually glad i did that rather than i'm glad i tell you when i wouldn't be at the five grand i wouldn't if you look at all the millions of people that have bought using help to buy schemes apartments i'll show you another article i'll show you another article um yeah but all these articles got loads of help to buy they're all like they have everything to do with help to buy all right look at this um this is uh help to buy with cladded apartments with nothing or grandfather graham the people that bought grenville and died with the fire which were council owned apartments were terrible apartments had cladding that was highly flammable which was a dreadful story okay but the people that died or the people that lived in those apartments bought those apartments with help to buy skiing so what they do is they sell their crap properties off to suckers vulnerable people that that are like oh go on then and then they sell their crap and then people end up being stuck in debt i think you're confusing crap new builds with the help department no i'm saying they help to buy these properties that people have helped to buy schemes are often terrible investments in fact they're not even investments they're that they're liabilities that people are having to live in it's almost like the government just want people to be so broke and so trapped you know in student debt then in debt buying new builds to live in what what about educating people to actually be financially literate and make good investment decisions rather than saying we're helping you is the thing right do you think it's a good thing having more homes in the uk well people need homes in the uk yes so do you think it's a good thing to have new homes in the uk um yeah because it's needed okay right so what's your issue here then is it with my issue is the the way that they market this to help to buy so your issue isn't to do with the scheme is to do with the marketing of the scheme my issue is to do with the way that they actually help it's actually helping the economy isn't it it's actually helping to help in the housing market it's not helping it's not helping um young families that are struggling to make ends meet that are getting stuck in these help no it's not helping them at all well it's helping them over just rent it it goes back to the very beginning of this conversation you're looking at this very much from your point of view as a developer from the economy i'm looking at it from the people that i speak to day in day out that are getting brainwashed by the government that getting sucked into this complete nonsense that that's all i'm thinking for i see what you're saying i see what you're saying and like but i actually here's a question here's a question then would you okay would you ever under any circumstances go into the help to buy scheme me personally yes well you know of course i wouldn't i haven't have i so so you'd never would you encourage your kids no i wouldn't know so yeah but because i know a better way what i'm saying is it's not the worst way so like obviously i would encourage them to invest and to rent where they live like what i do i think that's the best way i don't think the health department so you would never do it you would never encourage your kids to do it but the government are going out there flogging it like it's the best thing since sliced bread with their own agenda with actually you know the government of everything so the thing is right is what you need to do is look at their schemes and go okay they're not doing this for me i don't see the government as my parents they're doing it for them right and i'm just gonna have a little look at them and see ah that one fits the best i agree with that i agree with that but most people most people most people don't do that most people see the headlines they have no idea they don't even understand the difference between good debt and bad debt do you think it's wrong that they've got of course they're gonna have their own agenda of course they are because they're also you know it's not like they're just they want there's this massive what's their agenda they're not teaching money in schools what's their agenda then of encouraging people to go to university someone said to me the other day is there any government grants for your property investors academy i was like no of course there's not because the last thing the government want you doing is coming on my academy it doesn't fit with their agenda their agenda is for you to get into student debt buy a house to live in have a job have a pension dangle the carrot to retire early and that i have a problem you know what is it interesting though i actually let's say for example that that all changed and suddenly everyone was was was going on the your academy and and everyone what would actually be obviously individual people benefit from that what would actually be the long term effects of that brilliant things amazing things go on what would it be i don't know i don't know the answer okay what i do and what you do yeah is we i train people to be an entrepreneur okay the definition of an entrepreneur is someone that solved people's problems for profit the more people the more entrepreneurs there are on the planet the more people everyone was an entrepreneur what would be amazing it'd be amazing who would you get to work for you well are you saying that are you saying that you can't be entrepreneurial work for somebody most millionaires are employees no i'm not saying we like entrepreneurs in our company entrepreneurs yeah so what i'm saying is when you leave school okay and we could go off on a whole nother thing now and i want to wrap this up in a minute but when you leave school at the moment it's either you go to university and you get a normal education and get a degree back by the government great or you go to college and then a trade you use your hands you are practical you become an apprentice they're the two options and they're the only two options people think and what i'm trying to do what we're trying to do is encourage people that there's a third option there is a third much better one the third option is to be an entrepreneur and not to be scoffed at laughed at ridiculed you know how badly i was ridiculed when i started when i was 17 and i said i'm going to be i'm going to go on first it's not the normal it's not the wrong way to become a normal a lot of people though i don't think that they would they won't want that route they want to go and and they don't want to do that if they want to go and get into bad debt and get into go get get a degree in geography and then get a career and retire at 67 years old on after working 40 hours a week for 40 years because they're not driven they just want a job but the problem i have the problem i have is that the government mislead people into they think that they're being helped when actually there's a much bigger agenda but what they probably should do okay maybe right but i think everyone knows the government got their own agenda i don't think they do i think people trust the government if you ask them do they trust the government though it's the same as when people say i don't trust politicians but they all listen to boris's speech and take it as gospel and people say they don't trust the media but they do the media bashed me and everyone thinks it must be true because the media said it but you ask people and they'll say no i don't trust the government i know i don't trust the media no i don't trust the politicians they actually in practice they do and the government are putting out messages that are completely misleading if i put messages out like the government put out i would be done by trading standards for misleading advertising would i not oh yeah so they're doing things that are so misleading that businesses can't do it but they get away with i think it's wrong but you but you but you should be able to what you should be able to make up your own mind but yeah but what i'm saying is people are being misled misled people are being shown one half of the picture yes and my job on youtube on the other half it's a show the other half yeah i agree with that make up your own mind at least at least at least at least look at the fact but i don't it's not like that it's not like the help to buy scheme is like an absolute con it's it's it's serving a purpose what it is it's fitting what it is is it's an absolute con it's exactly what it is guys we're gonna wrap up it was an interesting one i'm beginning to dislike russell more and more by the day maybe you agree with russell maybe you agree with me maybe you have your own opinion what i want though is i want to see what you think comment below in the comment box if you want to see another video a bit like this me must having another argument you beat me at the last argument i think i might have had the edge on this one i don't think we're a million miles away what we think if you want to see me invest having another argument check it out up here right there that's amazing also if you want to see my students that are winning because they didn't believe the nonsense of the government and russell speak then check out a whole list of them up here right here and don't forget to subscribe to my channel but not russell's he doesn't even have a channel my channel subscription is right here subscribe i'll see you next time i don't agree with the government i'm just saying it's not terrible ,2
oH6fNzKRp8o,"SID:[TO AUDIENCE] NOW THE
SUPERNATURAL INFORMATION THAT THE GOD HAS PUT INTO
PAUL MCGUIRE I WANT YOU TO LEARN SOME OF THAT. YOU READY? YA' OPEN ? AUDIENCE:YES! PAUL:PRAISE THE LORD. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME
HERE. SO I'LL JUST SHARE A
NUMBER OF THINGS THAT THE LORD HAS PUT ON MY HEART. NUMBER 1, IS IN THE
SHORTNESS OF THE SHOW IT'S HARD TO GET INTO ALL THE
INTENSITY. I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT
I'M THE TYPE OF GUY, I WILL RESEARCH-I WORK 12
HOURS A DAY- I'M CONSTANTLY RESEARCHING
THOUSANDS OF PAGES BECAUSE EVERYTHING I TEACH ON
PROPHECY, EVERYTHING, I AM ALWAYS A
SKEPTIC. I DON'T BELIEVE IT, AND I
JUST DON'T BELIEVE IT, IT SOUNDS TOO FAR-FETCHED. SO WHEN I DELVE INTO THE
SUBJECT, AND I SEE THE FIRST-HAND
SCIENTIFIC REPORTS, ETC., ETC. THEN I REALIZE
IT'S TRUE AND THEN I CAN SPEAK ABOUT IT
PASSIONATELY, DESPITE WHETHER OR NOT
PEOPLE THINK LIKE I'M FROM OUTER SPACE. I KNOW IT'S TRUE 'CAUSE I
DID MY HOMEWORK. AND EVERY TIME I GET
CHALLENGED IN THE DEBATE, AND I MEAN THIS
RESPECTFULLY, USUALLY THE PERSON
DEBATING WITH ME AND ATTACKING ME FOR SAYING
WHAT I'VE SAID HAS INVESTED ABOUT 5 MINUTES
OF TIME ON THE RESEARCH, INEVITABLY, BECAUSE I'LL
ASK 'EM. BUT THE LORD HAS TAUGHT ME
TO BE COMPASSIONATE, BECAUSE I USED TO BE THAT
WAY TOO. YOU KNOW IF YOU'VE NEVER
HEARD THIS STUFF, LET'S BE HONEST, IT SOUNDS
LIKE A SCI-FI MOVIE. OKAY? SO IF YOU FEEL THAT WAY
TOWARDS WHAT I SAID, YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND,
OKAY? I'M NOT MAD AT YOU. I USED TO BE THE SAME WAY. SO HERE'S THE DEAL. THERE ARE THINGS GOING ON
IN OUR WORLD, THAT REALLY THEY'RE IN A
LOT OF THE SCIENCE FICTION MOVIES, BUT WHAT A LOT OF
PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND, [IS] THEY'RE TRUE. WE ARE LIVING IN THE WORLD
OF THE FUTURE. I DON'T KNOW HOW OLD YOU
ALL ARE, I CAN KIND OF GUESS SOME
OF YOU, OTHERS I HAVE NO IDEA. BUT I KNOW WHEN I WAS A
KID, CELL PHONE? WITH THE TV THING IN IT. MAN, PERSONAL COMPUTER? WHEN I STARTED WRITING
BOOKS I USED THE REGULAR TYPEWRITER, AND THEN I
MADE THE BIG TRANSITION TO SOME REALLY CHEAP WORD
PROCESSOR. AND THEN I REMEMBER IN THE
EARLY [DAYS], I'VE WRITTEN 22 BOOKS, I
REMEMBER IN THE EARLY DAYS WHITE-OUT WAS FINALLY
INVENTED. AUDIENCE:[APPLAUSE] PAUL:
MAN, THAT SAVED MY LIFE 'CAUSE
I COULD GO TO THE XEROX MACHINE AND IF YOU DID IT
REALLY GOOD IT LOOKS LIKE AN ORIGINAL. AND REMEMBER THE
TYPEWRITERS THAT USED TO AUTO ERASE? AUDIENCE:YEAH! PAUL:OKAY. WELL, NOW WE HAVE WORD
PROCESSORS. THAT'S HUGE. AND BECAUSE OF THE
INTERNET I USED TO HAVE TO GO THE LIBRARY AND POUR
THROUGH BOOKS AND GO TO 20 LIBRARIES TO FIND FACTS. NOW YOU CAN GOOGLE SEARCH
AND IF YOU KNOW HOW TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE
LUNATIC WEB SITES FROM AREA 51 AND THE REGULAR
ONES YOU CAN FIND INTERESTING INFORMATION. OKAY. SO BECAUSE OF THIS
RESEARCH I BELIEVE THAT WE ARE IN THE TIME
IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE RETURN OF THE LORD. AND PEOPLE ASK ME, 'WHY?'
I CAN GIVE YOU ALL KINDS OF DOCUMENTATION. YOU GOT A TASTE OF IT
TONIGHT. I DON'T SET DATES, EVER! THE LORD COULD SURPRISE
ME. I'M PUTTING MY KIDS
THROUGH COLLEGE AND EVERYTHING ELSE THROUGH A
LOT OF LOANS-AND YOU KNOW I'M PLANNING FOR THE
FUTURE. BUT THE CLOSENESS TO THE
LORD'S RETURN, ALL THE PROPHETIC SIGNS
ARE HERE. OKAY? NOW- BUT AMERICA... I BEGAN TO TEACH
ALL THIS STUFF, BECAUSE I'M AN EXPERT,
UNFORTUNATELY, IN MIND CONTROL AND IN
MANY OTHER THINGS THAT ARE JUST KIND OF FIELDS-IT'S
LIKE OPENING PANDORA'S BOX- YOU JUST WISH YOU
HADN'T GOTTEN THERE, BUT NOW YOU KNOW WHAT YOU
KNOW AND YOU'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH IT. AND I RESEARCH A LOT OF
VERY INTENSE FIELDS SUCH AS THE OCCULT AND THE
LUCIFERIAN ELITE THAT REALLY EXIST AND REALLY DO
RUN THIS PLANET. THEY'RE REAL PEOPLE. SEE, THE BIBLE SAYS THAT
WE ARE IN A SPIRITUAL WAR. APOSTLE PAUL [SAYS]: FOR
OUR FIGHT IS NOT AGAINST FLESH AND BLOOD BUT
AGAINST PRINCIPALITIES AND POWERS AND THE DARK UNSEEN
FORCES OF WICKEDNESS IN HEAVENLY PLACES. [EPHESIANS 6:12]
CHRISTIANS FOR THE MOST PART GIVE LIP SERVICE TO
THAT BUT THEY DON'T REALLY TAKE IT SERIOUSLY. SO THE REALITY IS LUCIFER
IS COMMUNICATING, HIS ORGANIZATIONAL
STRUCTURE IS LIKE A PYRAMID THAT GOES BACK TO
PHARAOH-AND THE SLAVES ARE AT THE BOTTOM AND, BY THE
WAY, ON THE BACK OF YOUR DOLLAR
BILL YOU SEE THE OCCULT PYRAMID. AND PROBABLY MOST OF YOU
ARE FAMILIAR WITH THAT EYE BALL IN THE PYRAMID ON THE
BACK OF YOUR DOLLAR BILL? THAT'S THE ALL-SEEING EYE
OF LUCIFER. OKAY? THAT'S SATAN'S EYE BALL. NOW ASK YOURSELF A
QUESTION: 'WHAT IS SATAN'S EYE BALL DOING ON THE BACK
OF THE DOLLAR BILL?' IN CASE YOU'RE CONFUSED AS TO
WHY-AND BY THE WAY THAT'S NOT MY OPINION. THAT IS THE OPINION OF
SCHOLARS, IT'S NOT A DEBATABLE THING
THAT I SAID IT. YOU CAN'T DEBATE THAT,
OKAY? YOU CAN TRY, BUT DO SOME
HOMEWORK AND THE DEBATE'S ENDED. OKAY. SO ON THE BOTTOM OF THE
PYRAMID ARE THE WORDS IN LATIN: NOVUS ORDO SECLORUM
NEW ORDER OF THE AGES  WHICH MEANS 'NEW WORLD
ORDER.' SO WE SEE ON THE BACK OF THE DOLLAR BILL AN
OCCULT PYRAMID WITH THE WORDS [THAT TRANSLATE AS]
NEW WORLD ORDER. [AND] THAT'S WHERE AMERICA
[COMES IN]-SIR FRANCIS BACON IN THE MID-1600'S
PLANNED FOR AMERICA TO BE THE NEW ATLANTIS AND THE
HEAD OF THE NEW WORLD ORDER. HE WAS THE HEAD OF THE
ROSICRUCIANS WHICH BECAME THE ILLUMINATI, AN OCCULT
SECRET SOCIETY WHICH GOES BACK TO ANCIENT BABYLON. ALL RIGHT? NOW THE ILLUMINATI
-THEY'RE STILL IN EXISTENCE TODAY, A VERY
POWERFUL OCCULT ORGANIZATION THAT RUNS THE
WORLD- REMEMBER THE ILLUMINATI FINANCED THE
COMMUNISTS AND THEY FINANCED HITLER. OKAY? THEY ALSO BACKED THE KKK
[KU KLUX KLAN]. WHAT DOES IT HAVE TO DO
WITH THE KKK? THE KKK IS THIS MASTER
RACE STUFF. OKAY? SO, THE GOAL IS TO GO INTO
A NEW WORLD ORDER, WHICH IS ALL IN THE BIBLE. NOW THE PHOENIX, WHICH I
FOR MOST OF MY LIFE THOUGHT WAS AN EAGLE-AND
THERE'S MANY OTHER OCCULT SYMBOLS ALL OVER THE
DOLLAR. OKAY? THE GOAL IS TO GO INTO A
GLOBAL CURRENCY-.WELL LOOK, NEVER BEFORE IN THE
HISTORY OF MANKIND WERE [WE] NOW IN A PLACE WHERE
THE GLOBAL CURRENCY IS WITHIN STRIKING DISTANCE. THE TARGET DATE IS 2018. THEY'VE MADE SIMILAR
ANNOUNCEMENTS, THEY MAY NOT HIT THAT
DATE, BUT THAT'S THEIR TARGET
DATE. AND THE TARGET NAME FOR
THE GLOBAL CURRENCY IS 'THE PHOENIX' BASED ON
THAT OCCULT BIRD. AMERICA IS MOVING VERY
QUICKLY INTO THIS NEW WORLD ORDER. OKAY? THAT'S WHY WE SEE ALL OF
THE TRANSFORMATION GOING [ON.] EVERYTHING THAT'S
HAPPENING FOR THE MOST PART IS NOT ACCIDENTAL,
IT'S STRATEGIC. ALL THE THINGS THAT APPEAR
TO BE RANDOM ARE NOT RANDOM THEY'RE PART OF A
PLAN. AND I'M JUST GONNA GET
DOWN TO IT REALLY BLUNTLY. THE MOTTO OF THE
ILLUMINATI, AN OCCULT ORGANIZATION,
WAS 'ORDER OUT OF CHAOS.' SO THE ILLUMINATI- THEY'RE
OCCULT- DELIBERATELY CREATES CHAOS SO THEY CAN
BRING IN THEIR NEW WORLD ORDER. THAT'S THEIR OPERATING
GAME PLAN. THAT'S WHY THEY FINANCE
THE RUSSIANS AND THE NAZIS. NUMBER 2, THE COMMUNIST
MANIFESTO, THAT-PROMISES THE WORKER'S
PARADISE, [THAT] WE'LL REDISTRIBUTE
THE WEALTH. YOU KNOW ALL OUR KIDS IN
SCHOOL ARE BEING TAUGHT THAT. YOU GO TO MOSCOW, MOSCOW'S
GOT MORE BILLIONAIRES THAT ANY OTHER CITY IN THE
WORLD. DO YOU SEE THE WEALTH
EQUALLY SHARED IN MOSCOW? I DON'T. DO YOU SEE THAT WEALTH
EQUALLY SHARED IN CUBA? DO YOU SEE THE WEALTH
EQUALLY SHARED IN CHINA? EVERYWHERE A COMMUNIST
DICTATORSHIP HAS BEEN INSTALLED THERE'S NO
WORKER'S PARADISE, THE WORKERS ARE WORSE OFF
THAN THEY EVER WERE. OKAY? [IT'S A] LIE. BUT GUESS WHAT? THE COMMUNIST MANIFESTO IS
A TOTAL MIRROR COPY OF THE ILLUMINATI OCCULT
MANIFESTO THAT WAS PUBLISHED A HUNDRED YEARS
EARLIER. SO THAT TELLS YOU THERE'S
A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COMMUNISM AND THE
ILLUMINATI. AND BY THE WAY  KARL MARX
THE AUTHOR OF THE COMMUNIST MANIFESTO WAS A
PRACTICING SATANIST. THEY DIDN'T TELL YOU THAT
IN SCHOOL BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW. HE WAS A PRACTICING
SATANIST AND HE HATED CHRIST. NOW, HITLER WAS ALSO
DEEPLY INVOLVED IN THE OCCULT. SO, IN AMERICA, SEE, IF WE
DON'T KNOW HISTORY-YOU KNOW THE OLD
EXPRESSION-'YOU'RE DOOMED TO REPEAT IT.' AMERICANS
DON'T KNOW HISTORY. MOST OF YOU PROBABLY KNOW
HISTORY A WHOLE LOT MORE THAN THE YOUNGER
GENERATIONS. WHY DID THE GERMAN
EVANGELICAL CHURCH LEGALLY VOTE FOR HITLER AS THEIR
HEAD? HE WAS VOTED INTO OFFICE. WHY DID THE EVANGELICAL
CHURCH OVERWHELMINGLY SUPPORT HITLER? AND THE QUESTION SHOULD BE
ASKED: 'IF THEY HAD THE HOLY SPIRIT INSIDE THEM
AND IF THEY HAD AN OUNCE OF SPIRITUAL DISCERNMENT
IN THEM AND THEY PAID ATTENTION AT ALL'-IT WAS
QUITE OUT IN THE OPEN-THAT THE THIRD REICH, BY THE
WAY, WAS NOT A POLITICAL PARTY
FIRST, IT WAS AN OCCULT PARTY
FIRST. EVERYBODY IN GERMANY KNEW
THAT. ALL THE SECRET OCCULT
SOCIETIES WERE OPENLY PUTTING HITLER INTO POWER
'SO HOW COME [IN] THE EVANGELICAL CHURCH NOBODY
HAD A DISCERNMENT FROM THE HOLY SPIRIT THAT THIS MAN
[HITLER] WAS DEMON-POSSESSED?' IF
SOMEBODY WALKED INTO THIS ROOM DEMON-POSSESSED AND
PRETENDED TO BE A LEADER, ALL OF YOU WITH THE HOLY
SPIRIT INSIDE, YOU WOULD HAVE THAT
UNCOMFORTABLE FEELING, RIGHT? BUT THEY WELCOMED HITLER
AS THE MESSIAH! WHY WAS THAT? WHY WAS THE EVANGELICAL
CHURCH SO HYPNOTIZED? THE-CHURCH IN AMERICA
TODAY IS IN THE EXACT SAME PLACE SPIRITUALLY AS THE
EVANGELICAL CHURCH WAS IN NAZI GERMANY. THAT'S A SERIOUS WARNING. BECAUSE IT GOES IN STEPS. FIRST YOU DEMONIZE
CHRISTIANS. WE'RE ON THE TOP OF THE
LIST. YOU CAN GO AND GOOGLE AND
SEARCH IT. THERE'S AN AIR FORCE
REPORT THAT CAME OUT THE OTHER DAY. EVANGELICAL CHRISTIANS ARE
NUMBER 1 ON THE LIST OF RELIGIOUS EXTREMISTS [AS]
POSSIBLE TERRORISTS. WE'RE ABOVE THE KKK, WE'RE
ABOVE AL QAEDA, WE'RE ABOVE THE MUSLIM
BROTHERHOOD. WHAT'S THAT ABOUT? OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT THAT
MEANS? IN A TIME OF CRISIS THEY
COME AFTER US FIRST. AND YOU ALL KNOW WHAT
[HAPPENED] IN NAZI GERMANY, WHERE IT LED TO
CONCENTRATION CAMPS AND SO ON AND SO FORTH. NOW, [AS] ALL THESE
PROPHETIC SIGNS HAPPENING, ARE WE SUPPOSED TO BE
PARALYZED IN FEAR AND DO NOTHING? NO, THAT'S WHAT THE DEVIL
WANTS US TO BELIEVE. SO I SHARED THE VISION I
HAD OF A GREAT AWAKENING IN AMERICA. NOW PEOPLE THINK, 'WELL
THAT INTERFERES WITH BIBLE PROPHECY.' IT'S AMAZING
HOW PEOPLE THINK EVERYTHING GOOD INTERFERES
WITH BIBLE PROPHECY. OKAY? NO, BECAUSE THERE'S
NOWHERE IN BIBLE PROPHECY WHICH SAYS YOU CAN'T HAVE
A GREAT-IT'S AMAZING THE LACK OF LOGIC AND COMMON
SENSE PEOPLE USE IN THEIR ARGUMENTS-THERE'S NOTHING
IN THE BIBLE AND IN BIBLE PROPHECY WHICH SAYS YOU
CAN'T HAVE A REVIVAL AND YOU CAN'T HAVE A GREAT
AWAKENING IN THE LAST DAYS. AND THE ARGUMENT IS, 'WELL
IT WILL BE A COUNTERFEIT REVIVAL, IT WILL BE THE
GREAT APOSTASY.' YES, THERE IS A GREAT APOSTASY,
IT'S GOING ON NOW. I COULD NAME CHURCHES AND
MOVEMENTS THAT ARE IN APOSTASY. AND THERE IS A COUNTERFEIT
REVIVAL AND IT'S GOING ON NOW. BOTH OF THOSE THINGS ARE
TRUE. BUT JUST BECAUSE THERE'S A
COUNTERFEIT REVIVAL DOESN'T MEAN THERE CAN'T
BE A BIBLICAL REVIVAL GOING ON AT THE SAME TIME. AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]
PAUL:AND HERE'S THE PROOF WHY. THE APOSTLE PAUL SAID THE
LAST DAYS BEGAN WHEN THE APOSTLE PAUL WAS TEACHING. SO, WE HAD 'THE
REFORMATION,' A MASSIVE GLOBAL REVIVAL DURING THE
LAST DAYS. WE HAD THE 'FIRST GREAT
AWAKENING' WHICH ROCKED THE AMERICAN COLONIES. WE WOULDN'T HAVE THE
FREEDOMS OF AMERICA TODAY IN OUR BILL OF RIGHTS AND
CONSTITUTION, AND BY THE WAY, IF YOU
BELIEVE IN THE BILL OF RIGHTS AND THE
CONSTITUTION ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND
SECURITY YOU ARE A TERRORIST. THAT'S A FACT! READ THE DOCUMENT ON THE
REPORT OF RIGHT WING EXTREMISM. O.K. SO, THERE WAS A '[SECOND]
GREAT AWAKENING' AND IT CHANGED OUR NATION AND IT
GAVE US THESE RADICAL FREEDOMS THAT NO OTHER
COUNTRY HAS. LIFE, LIBERTY AND THE
PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS AND STUFF LIKE THAT-FREEDOM OF
SPEECH, FREEDOM OF RELIGION, THAT
CAME FROM THE CHRISTIAN INPUT, IT CAME FROM THE
REVIVAL OF THE 'FIRST GREAT AWAKENING.' THAT WAS
IN THE LAST DAYS. THE 'SECOND GREAT
AWAKENING' WHICH PARTIALLY FREED THE SLAVES WITH
CHARLES FINNEY. THAT WAS IN THE LAST DAYS. THE HEALING REVIVALS IN
1940'S,1948. THAT WAS IN THE LAST DAYS. THE 'JESUS MOVEMENT,' HOW
I GOT SAVED, OR THE 'CHARISMATIC
MOVEMENT.' THAT WAS IN THE LAST DAYS. SO I'VE GIVEN YOU NUMEROUS
ILLUSTRATIONS OF POWERFUL REVIVALS THAT HAVE ALL
OCCURRED IN THE LAST DAYS. SO WHY CAN NOT THERE BE
ANOTHER REVIVAL IN THE LAST DAYS BEFORE THE LORD
RETURNS? THERE CAN BE  AND THERE
WILL BE. YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE YOU CAN'T FULFILL
THE GREAT HARVEST BEFORE THE RETURN OF THE LORD IF
YOU DON'T HAVE THE POWER OF THE LORD. JESUS CHRIST SAID- PAUL: [READS] PAUL:AND THEN YOU ASK
ANYTHING IN HIS NAME. THERE'LL BE MIRACLES,
YOU'LL HAVE SUPERNATURAL POWER IF YOU ABIDE IN THE
VINE, WHICH IS JESUS CHRIST, YOU
WILL MOVE MIRACULOUSLY. WE CANNOT FULFILL THE
GREAT END TIME SOUL HARVEST ON OUR OWN
STRENGTH. THAT SOUL HARVEST IS
PRODUCED BY CHRISTIANS WHO ARE FILLED WITH THE
SUPERNATURAL POWER OF THE HOLY SPIRIT AND REVIVAL. SO THAT'S THE END OF THE
ARGUMENT OF THE CRITICS. OKAY? [THE]ARGUMENT IS OVER. NOW, HERE'S THE DEAL FOR
YOU AND I: BECAUSE I LOVE YOU, I TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
OKAY? AND SO-THERE'S A LOT OF
PREACHERS THAT THEY MOCK FIRE AND BRIMSTONE
PREACHING-JESUS WAS A FIRE AND BRIMSTONE PREACHER. FOUNDER AND FATHER OF THE
'FIRST GREAT AWAKENING,' JONATHAN EDWARDS, YOU READ
HIS SERMON 'SINNERS IN THE HANDS OF AN ANGRY GOD' 2
HOURS OF THE MOST GRAPHIC DESCRIPTION OF HELL, AND
THE TORMENTS OF HELL, AND FIRE AND BRIMSTONE
YOU'LL EVER READ IN YOUR LIFE! AND HE CHANGED THE NATION. HE WAS A FIRE AND
BRIMSTONE PREACHER! NOW, ONE OTHER THING: AND
THAT IS YOU HAVE AN ASSIGNMENT. THE ASSIGNMENT IS CALLED
'AMERICA.' DO NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE LIE OF
THE DEVIL. THE FLAMING MISSILES OF
THE EVIL ONE. GOD IS NOT FINISHED WITH
AMERICA YET. AMERICA HAS NOT BECOME SO
EVIL THAT GOD HAS TAKEN HIS HAND COMPLETELY OFF OF
AMERICA. I'M NOT SAYING THAT WE ARE
NOT EXPERIENCING THE JUDGMENT OF GOD TO SOME
DEGREE. AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT
GOD IS NOT ALLOWING US TO BE CHASTISED NOR AM I
SAYING THAT WE'RE NOT IN THE GREATEST DANGER WE'VE
EVER BEEN IN. BUT I'M SAYING THE HAND OF
GOD IS STILL ON OUR NATION AT THIS MOMENT AND IN THE
SPIRITUAL REALM GOD IS GIVING US A BRIEF
OPPORTUNITY TO RELEASE HIS POWER IN THIS NATION. BUT THAT RELEASE CAN'T
HAPPEN IF YOU'RE GONNA EMBRACE THE LIE THAT GOD
IS FINISHED WITH AMERICA. LISTEN! GOD IS NOT FINISHED WITH
AMERICA AND GOD IS NOT FINISHED WITH YOU! AND THAT IDEA THAT GOD IS
FINISHED WITH AMERICA IS JUST LIKE SOMEBODY WHO IS
POSSESSED BY A DEMON. AS LONG AS YOU HOLD ONTO
IT YOU'RE PARALYZED. SO GOD WANTS TO BREAK THAT
SPIRIT OFF OF YOUR LIFE AND THE LIFE OF OTHER
PEOPLE SO THAT HE CAN SEND A THIRD GREAT AWAKENING
AND POWER CONTINGENT UPON REPENTANCE AND YOUR
ASKING. GOD SAYS: 'CALL UNTO ME
AND I WILL ANSWER THEE, AND SHOW THEE GREAT AND
MIGHTY THINGS WHICH THOU KNOWEST NOT.' [JEREMIAH 33:3]
PAUL: [PRAYING AND IMPARTING] SO LORD WE
PRAY RIGHT NOW IN THE NAME OF JESUS, WE THANK YOU
THAT YOU ARE A GOD OF MIRACLES. WE DECLARE GOD THAT YOU
ARE NOT FINISHED WITH AMERICA AND WE BREAK THAT
SPIRIT OFF OF THE CHURCH AND THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF
ALL GOD'S PEOPLE. YOU ARE NOT FINISHED WITH
AMERICA, AND LORD, RIGHT NOW IN THE
NAME OF JESUS WE RECEIVE BY FAITH THE OUTPOURING OF
A THIRD GREAT AWAKENING. WE RECEIVE BY FAITH AN
INFUSION OF POWER, AND RIGHT NOW IN THE NAME
OF JESUS I WANT YOU TO NOT DOUBT, SIMPLY BE OPEN TO
IT LIKE A LITTLE CHILD-AT THIS MOMENT THE LORD IS
SETTING YOU ON FIRE WITH THE POWER OF THE HOLY
SPIRIT, AND IF YOU FOCUS YOUR EYES
ON THE LORD YOU'RE GONNA NOTICE THAT YOU ARE BEING
SET ON FIRE BY THE POWER OF THE HOLY SPIRIT, AND
THAT YOU ARE BURNING IN THE HOLY SPIRIT. AND THAT BURNING AND THAT
FIRE IS A THIRD GREAT AWAKENING, AND EVERYBODY
IN THIS ROOM WHO IS OPEN TO IT AND NOT RESISTING IT
IS BEING SET ON FIRE BY THE POWER OF THE HOLY
SPIRIT. YOU'RE BURNING AND YOU'RE
BEING SET ON FIRE. AND THE LORD IS BREATHING
HIS LIFE IN YOU AND THE LORD WANTS YOU TO KNOWS
THAT AT THIS SECOND  NOT TOMORROW NOT NEXT WEEK 
BUT AT THIS SECOND THE LORD IS SETTING YOU ON
FIRE AT A GREATER DIMENSION IN THE SPIRITUAL
REALM, AND THERE IS A
SUPERNATURAL IMPARTATION WITH FORCE, WITH DOMINION,
WITH KINGDOM GLORY, AND THE SPIRIT OF GOD IS
SETTING YOU ON FIRE-AND I SPEAK TO YOU NOW UNDER THE
ANOINTING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT THAT YOU HAVE BEEN
SET ON FIRE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE YOU WERE CALLED
FOR SUCH A TIME AS THIS. AND THE LORD IS SAYING HE
WANTS YOU TO RISE IN SPIRITUAL AUTHORITY AND
ALLOW HIM TO SET YOU ON FIRE. AND FOR EVERY SINGLE
PERSON THAT HAS RECEIVED THAT WITH CHILD-LIKE FAITH
YOU ARE BEING SET ABLAZE IN THE SPIRIT. YOU ARE BEING SET ON FIRE
BY THE SPIRIT. AND THE LORD IS SAYING:
'YOU WILL REMEMBER THIS DAY FOR THE REST OF YOUR
LIFE FOR THIS WAS THE DAY THAT I LIT YOU ON FIRE
AGAIN FOR A PURPOSE.' IN JESUS NAME. AMEN AND AMEN. [AUDIENCE: APPLAUSE] ",2
cjgsJscMRf8,[Applause] [Music] foreign [Applause] this is the paul mcguire report i'm paul mcguire america is in chaos and you see that on the various mainstream media news channels specifically the cable news channels other channels video audio social media and the internet at the same time that we see chaos in america we see trends movements indicators of uh positive outcomes for a lack of a better term things that will implement positive change some change is good some changes evil or awful it depends what is within the category of change and we always have to remember that america is a completely unique nation it's different than the rest of the world not just because i say so or somebody else says so because it is it's a factual statement to say that america is unique among the other nations of the earth thus the term american exceptional america is the only nation on planet earth which is governed by legal documents that were produced from biblical thought or a biblical worldview because our founding fathers like thomas jefferson abraham lincoln george washington or whoever whether or not they were quote evangelical christians whether or not they were like pilgrim or puritan type christians or whether or not they were some strange hybrid theology somewhere between the bible and freemasonry they say that's impossible and you may well be right it may well be impossible to synthesize those two opposite theological belief systems because one is occultic one is biblical but in any case because of the superior excellence of the biblical pilgrimage educational institutions in the 1600s and 1700s all of our founding fathers were exposed to intelligent intellectual historical philosophical theological they were exposed to biblical thinking rigorously and a biblical worldview why because the pilgrim and uh puritan educational establishments were so superior to any of the others on every level not just the spiritual level the historical mathematical level as well they were so superior that even if a founding father was a person who embraced freemasonry or masonry or whatever they were still inundated with biblical thought and it showed up in the decisions and the unique legal or documents we have for america called the bill of rights and the constitution final mind is that no other nation has a bill of rights and a constitution that provides anywhere near as much freedom as ours does period and that's what makes america america american exceptionalism because it is every other nation begins with a quasi tyranny even if it's a soft tyranny even if it's a subtle tyranny it's a quasi tyranny because it does not embrace the truth that our founding fathers said should be self-evident that it is the creator capital c that has given us certain inalienable rights that means rights that are given to a people by god since they're given to a people by god they can't be taken away by a finite government that the creator capital c has given us certain inalienable rights such as life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that produces freedom of religion freedom of the speech freedom of press and many other freedoms which allows america to be the only nation on planet earth that has what's called the american dream think about this for a moment this certainly is never talked about in the marxist socialist educational systems that dominate america and that is the truth that america is uniquely free because of its biblical worldview it's never even acknowledged by the marxist professors who who have infected our educational system with a virus far worse an ideological virus far worse far more deadly than the coronavirus because it it produces a death sentence for people at a higher percentage rate ultimately than the coronavirus does so what's happening in america now today as you're listening what's happening in america today is impacting and affecting the entire planet earth in endless endless ways because we set the tone we set the model for freedom or or loss of freedom right now as i've said countless times and i've titled the title of my book the greatest battle for the hearts and minds of mankind in history of the world that's where we are now and in a very short period of time america will have chosen a pathway that either guarantees the preservation of your liberties of your freedoms of the right to buy and own your own house to pursue an american dream america will either have embarked on that pathway he says no uh there's no middle ground or america will have embarked on the pathway of totalitarianism bring up big big brother an orwellian totalitarian regime a dictatorship it's one road or the other and anybody who does not acknowledge the fact that there are at least two fundamentally basic different roads that produce two basic fundamentally different futures is either chronically stupid on the area you're so stupid you should be arrested it should be a crime that's how stupid you are criminal criminality is stupid or you should be arrested for your stupidity either you fit into that category and that's why you can't grasp what's going on or you fit into the category of you know nothing about history and the historical precedent because every single nation on the face of the earth that has embarked down the path of socialism marxism has always ended up in a unfree totalitarian state with poverty with no social justice with all your freedom stripped and stolen from you by a big brother government there's no deviation as we know and there's no exception to this rule absolutely none it's a hundred percent death rate for nations that embrace communism socialism yet in the light of that you have these uh pitter-patter airhead christians who who live in some who float above the ground as they walk they're so spiritual they're so ignorant of the fact that the fundamental characteristics of a marxist atheist socialist society fundamental characteristic is that buried beneath all the rhetoric on social justice and redistributing wealth and oh how much we love you and buried beneath all of that stuff is the historical reality that people who embrace this communist marxist socialist state always end up living in a tyranny they never get their social justice their wealth redistribution their freedoms are taken away and they become uh prisoners in a concentration camp type of society that's the historical record that's why since communism um has invaded numerous nations with its deception various communist revolutions that have occurred over the last 135 years or so have produced a total death rate of around it's always secretive 240 million people have died through starvation execution shot to death concentration camp re-education camp um or they send the people in communist societies who don't adhere to communism into mental hospitals where they have wrought and died this is this is reality so not to know reality and not to know history really is a crime especially in light of the fact that the people who are going to suffer are the children and the grandchildren and the little children and the children becoming into young adults and adults etc in fact every age category of men suffered brutally under no exception no deviation to that rule and right now america is voting whether or not literally to send us into a communist socialist future or let's call it a capitalist christian future which way which way will america choose yeah america has been dumbed down you know that but america willingly signed up to be dumped down especially in the church they were the first line and now as anything god's law of sowing and reaping which is phrased by many kind of slang expressions like the chickens come home to roost is kind of another way of saying uh the law of sowing whatever you sow so should you reap you start promoting and spreading the doctrine of communism like seeds and soil which is the hearts and minds of little boys and little girls you're going to have a harvest of wickedness a harvest of evil it's inevitable that's what you sowed you sowed wickedness what kind of harvest did you expect in the same way jesus christ tells us that uh whatever we sow so shall we also reap but jesus christ also tells us to go into all the world and preach the gospel evangelize the loss what is that you're planting the seeds of the word of god soil which is the hearts and minds of mankind in order to reap a soul harvest which means to win souls for jesus christ to evangelize the loss that's the purpose of paul mcguire ministries and paradise mountain church is to evangelize the loss and jesus tells us regarding our time period that the harvest fields are white for harvest but the laborers the amount of people willing to go out and bring in and and plant the seeds for the souls to be saved and then to bring in spiritual harvest through evangelism the laborers jesus said are few that's characteristic of our time but this ministry paul mcguire ministries paradise mountain church along with you who are partners with us you're committed i'm committed to not only saving souls but to bring in the last day of soul harvest jesus said fields are white for harvest but the laborers are few why are the fields of white for harvest because we're in the last days the prophetic signs are being fulfilled and god it's god's prophetic destiny for america and other nations and regions of the world it's god's prophetic destiny for america to act as a great vehicle of god for a great last days soul harvest which we can go out and reap because the harvest is is what white feels her wife for harvest people are at such a place emotionally and spiritually that there are countless millions of people ready to uh receive christ into their lives in fact the most powerful thing that we can do to change a family a people a nation a community one of the most powerful things you can do to change any of these things for the better is to effectively preach the gospel of jesus christ to effectively win souls to to effectively bring in the fields that are white for harvest yes spiritual warfare is essential yes being informed and active is essential yes but along with that other things that we should be doing is preaching the gospel and winning the laws making disciples of all nations and occupying the land will become this is there's nothing that is as powerful as that in terms of transforming a nation we complain about the evil and the evils and the wickedness in america one can understand why but the evils in wickedness in america there is a cure there is an antidote and the antidote is the aggressive preaching effectively of the gospel of jesus christ in order to win souls that will transform any people group any nation radically and so that is what paul mcguire ministries in paradise mountain church that's our number one goal and that's why i ask you on a regular basis to be intercessory prayer partners with us praying for me my family in this ministry that's why i ask you to spread the links of our programs our social media our internet media to spread them far and wide to under ordinary uh circumstances get what we use and that's why i ask you to go before the board seek to take the lord and simply ask the lord how much would you have need to give financially in terms of contributions or donations paul mcguire ministries paradise mountain church and whatever the lord tells you to do you obey him because that is how we are able to fund and support and activate the preaching of the gospel of jesus christ the making disciples of all nations teaching of the word of god and on numerous platforms as you know right now we're expanding our platforms we're uh adopting multiple new platforms as a edge against censorship and that's why you need to write down or put yourself on or how whatever you do to remember paul mcguire ministries at fridayon.com bradyon.com and our main portal is paul mcguire us and we're going to be adding to you other social media platforms because there's a war against the truth on the internet i was watching it today a number of biggest of the biggest tech giants you know arrogant uh thinking that they can act like uh self-serving gods and just deciding that they're going to censorship this or that these people don't believe in free speech they believe in what whatever they say goes whatever their perspective is is the right perspective that's a totalitarian approach there's no respect for the beliefs of others whether you agree with it or not america is great or has been great because it has been a champion of freedom of speech that means everybody whether you agree with them or not has an opportunity to communicate with their speech or technology or whatever openly now that's changed in america because freedom is under assault why is freedom under assault because secretly behind the scenes the globalist elite along with the trillions of dollars they have to spend are re-molding america reshaping america to be a globalist little unit inside of a globalist control dominated one world government one religion one world economic system the new world order predicted in genesis 11 when god judged ancient babylon at the time of the power of babel divided it from being a one-world government into many independent uh nation-states all of this is happening now it's like a whirlwind and there are powerful interests that are totalitarian like the way they control the masses your children my children grandchildren other people's children adults the way they control the masses is through mass mind control which occurs primarily through the internet through social media through television through episodic tv through movies through films through music through uh lyrics so-called scientist speaking but only certain kinds of scientists scientists like all the other groups i just mentioned have to be carefully pre-screened their so-called scientific beliefs or their so-called beliefs as entertainers must adhere to must inform to whatever the big brother orwellian view dictates or demands at the present moment so there's no freedom of speech there's only freedom of big brother type speech that's where we are and see where this leads that's where we are but where it leads is to the place where they tear down all platforms that preach biblical christianity or preach conservative ideas based on the bible or whatever all of those platforms and individuals using those platforms will be shut down and silenced because a dictatorship does not tolerate it it talks infinitely about the need for being tolerant it talks infinitely about the need to respect diversity but in practice it it rules dictatorially on an infinite basis brushing out all freedoms all freedom of speech all all diversity uh is tolerant of nothing it's the it's the ultimate paradox the free speech movement which began in the late 1960s when i was a little kid i i supported the belief systems of the free speech movement which occurred at the university of berkeley and the free speech movement basically was a national movement adopted by the hippies and the radicals which i was part of which said that you have the right to say anything you want to say you have the right to believe anything you want to believe that's what free speech is but when the people who who adopted this idea of free speech in their free speech movement they didn't calculate the wrong turn that the entire radical liberal movement would make over the next decades they didn't they didn't calculate where the free speech movement would ultimately end up and that is it ends up in a place where you have no free speech where a word has to be evaluated on whether or not it's politically correct and if a word or a term is not politically correct then it is censored it's deleted and there's mass surveillance technology along with artificial intelligence etc etc which is constantly scanning the internet scanning websites scanning emails scanning every part of your life in order to determine whether you're adhering to the big brother totalitarian directives or not there's that's where we are and this place where we are is a new world order america which is completely different than the original america which was america now the real game plan for this new world order america is to shove america into this globalist finance one world government one world religion one world economic system or what is known as the new world order and the new world order will prop up and continue to enrich the super elite super wealthy and it will continue to destroy the lifestyle the income uh of the working class and the middle class under the guise of saving the planet via climate change or whatever the latest bruises whatever the latest con game is now god's given us this time in history right now this time because this is the time that once you walk through the door you can't get back in when you walk through the door when you walk through the door into the wrong future unfortunately the door self locks you can't get back in because if you walk through the door of the wrong new future you're not allowed to go back and to retrieve beliefs that they've carefully filtered out you are in a giant sensor machine a censorship machine that cannot be undone you need to think about that because that's where we are right now and the future that we walk through will determine future of our children and grandchildren god is sovereign the lord of the bible is sovereign jesus christ as king of kings and lord of lords his prophetic word will come true within the time period of god's prophetic word coming true there's going to be a variation of the level of persecution the level of martyrdom the level of loss of freedoms there will be a variation in the intensity of that as you go from neighborhood to neighborhood state to state geographic area the geographic area nation to nation and nations where the collective tone spiritually of the people for example in america where people are fervently biblical for people are committed to the bible old testament testament where people are committed to evangelism those areas uh will go in a better direction than those states and communities that are built on a collective worldview of socialism or marxism or communism why people shared this before ideas produce consequences good ideas produce good consequences and bad ideas produce bad consequences so it's important that you dedicate i dedicate my life to the communication to the dissemination of good ideas which are our ideas based on biblical ideas and that we do everything we can and everything in our power to spread those good ideas which are god ideas which come from the bible that we do everything we can to spread god's word to other peoples to young people people all over this nation to communities all over the world that's the that's the primary spiritual weapon that can preserve our freedoms so you and i need to obey the word of god where it teaches us to do this and so we need to be committed as most of you are prayerfully i am by god's grace that's why paul mcguire ministries is committed to moving forward to bringing in this last day soul harvest to communicating a biblical worldview and by acquiring technologies that will enable us to avoid the schemes of the evil one that wants to censor and tear us down and with your help your financial partnership your donations your prayers your willingness to spread our message far and wide we can overcome or do an end run around uh censorship machines that are aggressive and use artificial intelligence we can do an end run around we you and i need to brace ourselves whatever the outcome of this election is there is going to be a season of turmoil and chaos and all kinds of weird stuff erupting and we need to pray now like we've ever prayed before and we need to pray ongoing fashion and then we need to pray for our nation after the election no matter who wins because we're going to enter a period of chaos and our prayers are are willing to use the spiritual authority that god has given us our prayers can be used by god to occupy the land until jesus comes because there are behind the scenes forces of evil forces of good for forces of wickedness forces of righteousness because ultimately as we talked about on the paul mcguire report countless times our fight is not with people not with political groups our fight is not against flesh and blood but our fight is against the principalities against powers against the dark unseen forces of wickedness in heavenly places so our primary battle whether it's for us as individuals is spiritual but our primary battle also is spiritual and encompasses nations elections cultures etc etc all of these things and the souls and destiny of millions of people all of these things can be changed or or altered by effective spiritual warfare so i ask you to to join with me in what i call the greatest battle for the hearts and minds of mankind and see the world go to paul mcguire.us and look at our book bundle discounts help us spread the message far and wide and every day it's just not how many minutes or hours you spend it's the fact that you're praying in accordance with god's word coming into the throne room of god boldly because of his grace through the blood of jesus christ and you are choosing to obey god's command upon your life you're choosing to be obedient and to be an intercessory prayer warrior and a spiritual warrior as you fight against invisible powers in the invisible realm spiritual powers of evil and together we're to be one in christ one in the supernatural body of christ fighting these principalities fight is gone we don't have much time what what is what is about to happen is is the tracks are being laid on you know the railroad tracks are being laid down on the ground train's about ready to come very quickly you need to simply ask the lord lord lord jesus i ask you give me wisdom what you want me to do regarding anything wait on the lord until he answers you and then you don't exalt your own imagination your own will your own decisions you don't exalt that above the voice of the lord speaking to you through his word don't do that that's idolatrous you obey the lord who's speaking to you through his word or if he's speaking to you through his spirit it's always in conforming to god's word god will lead you step by step and you'll know exactly what to do and you'll feel good about that decision because that decision is the decision that will bring you freedom know the truth and act on the truth you're set free the goal here the game plan areas is to be resolved in your heart and mind that you are well able to occupy the land spiritually as joshua and caleb said and so you place and you're well able to take the land not because you're such a hot shot or whatever but because your faith is in the supernatural power of god as we exercise that together we're able to occupy the land the devil is going to occupy it we're going to occupy it and that also means occupying the land in the time of an election god bless you this is your brother paul mcfire is it paul mcguire.us that's paul mcguire.us the clock is ticking is it paul mcguire us for all kinds of free resources but remember the clock is ticking you're either praying in a serious serious way or you're awol from spiritual battle i i challenge you to engage in the spiritual battle and to be functional as a spiritual prayer warrior and to obey what god is telling you to do now now is the time you may not have i may not have this opportunity blessed god bless you your brother in christ paul mcguire visit paul mcguire [Applause] us [Applause] [Applause] [Laughter] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Applause] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hmm [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] bye [Music] you ,2
UeiUQhM8MiE,[Applause] [Music] foreign [Applause] this is the paul mcguire report i'm paul mcguire there are so many things happening right now in the united states of america and globally but especially in the united states of america which exercises an enormous amount of power economically politically culturally um across the entire world and we are in the election season and in addition to being in an election season this particular election season happens to represent two entirely different visions for america two doorways two different doorways into the future so based on analyzing what's happening now and by analyzing i mean reviewing studying education of the data the statistics the broad spectrum of diverse fields of information like neuropsychiatry and biomedicine and you know i'm not a doctor or anything but i could go on with all the different new fields in science and biology and genetics and neuroscience and brain science etc etc and all of these are synergistically combining with one another genetics for example and then on top of that we have this coronavirus which has uh allowed depending upon where you live what state you live in a blue state or a red state it is provided the opportunity for there to be a complete or partial shutdown of many businesses services jobs occupations uh people who have spent their entire lifetime building up a family business or their own business those are the people by the way who who are the main target because there are powerful people in this world and you need to understand who these people are for crying out loud you need to understand that it's not a conspiracy theory that's a that's a little fairy tale you've been told for the purpose of mind control so so they simply play up or play against your innate fear your your desire to be accepted by everybody and god forbid that you would deviate from the norm mentally and by deviating from the norm mentally i'm not talking about going insane uh rather i'm talking more about ken kizi's famous novel one flew with a cuckoo's nest and they made a film with it with jack nicholson and it takes place inside a mental hospital where an all powerful authoritarian totalitarian character called the big nurse micromanages everybody's life inside the insane asylum through medication through being disciplined and all kinds of they say they're medical procedures but they're really control procedures and by the way ken keezy who i met in central park many years ago i didn't know it at the time when i met him i didn't know he was had a relationship with the cia as did timothy larry and others all these people not all a number of the most famous people who were promoting the usage of psychedelic drugs like lsd such as can keezy um were really working for the central intelligence agency that's not a conspiracy theory that's like if you have half a brain and you use half your brain and you read some books or pages so for example i talk about all this in uh my book bundle or where the book the day the dollar died and a prophecy of the future of america i talked about this but because keysi even though he was working at stanford research university he volunteered to take part in a psychological experiment which was really a mind control experiment but then later on and during that he he had a job where he would work inside the mental hospital and he took acid he dropped lsd while he was inside the mental hospital and as the story goes that's where he wrote his best-selling novel one flew over the cuckoo's nest the whole message of the novel ironically was that a totalitarian dictatorship this time in the form of a female called the big nurse was going to control every facet of your life through a totalitarian socialist society that was depicted by the institution of a mental hospital the mental hospital according to kizi's writing was symbolic of america now this guy was a radical and a liberal but his message was be careful because a totalitarian government is rising all around you and it disguises itself in many different forms and there are people who want to micromanage your life in an american society take away all your freedoms and then some kind of big nurse will will run every facet of your life and so of course uh teasy's hero in the novel played by jack nicholson leads a rebellion inside the mental hospital and the the so-called so-called insane patients uh for the first time in their lives experience freedom and uh and what it means to be free from control uh embodied in in the lead character played by jack nicholson so that novel and i don't remember when it came out my mother took me to see the play of it and i read the book about it so i'm guessing i don't know it must have come out in the 50s or 60s probably the 60s or perhaps the very early 70s but now we're in that world you see we are no longer in the world of um at least in america it depends where you live on planet earth but you see the american model of this rising all-controlling totalitarian state is is much more like the big nurse that ken kesey warned about because it comes off superficially as compassionate and caring and of course all the micromanagement and total control of your life and total control of your mind uh is is done superficially with softness when in actuality it's it's a much it's it's she's the bride of frankenstein and so that's where we are in america we have we have a totalitarian regime if you will rising right in front of our eyes in the midst of the chaos and that's what these riots are all about all of this riots all of these chaos all of the chaos most of them some are spontaneous if you ignore all the facts but most of them have been set up or engineered and the purpose this is a formula that those in the occult elite have been using for centuries order out of chaos and the communists which are also occultists you see this this nonsense that you hear that communism marxism and socialism is atheistic and only believes in science is a bunch of hogwash got the secret truth of communism and marxism and the illuminati and socialism is that it is satanism it contains all the or most of the tenets of satanism and secretly the the most famous communist revolutionaries secretly many of the top people like lenin and stalin and many many others and national socialists like adolf hitler were secretly all involved in satanism and the occult at the very top so that's where that's where we are in america now and when you turn on the television first of all let me say this uh i am i am not one of these people who deny that the coronavirus exists right sorry what it is where it came from i can tell you my my suspicion i've told you my suspicion of where it came from on previous programs uh how how it transmits etc etc many of those things remain uh unclear but there definitely is an illness or a sickness that's being spread now it's being used for political for the acquisition of political power and it's being used as a pretense to dominate dictatorially society and it's very interesting that the people who are running things who they put on their list of you know the heroes who they put on the list of of the the professions and institutions in society that are most needed that we need to keep going during a pandemic these institutions and and these individuals and these job types that are are considered arbitrarily but by society as being you know in priority the the most important things and that would include by the way depending what state you live in things like prostitutes still being able to conduct business i won't go further than that that would include marijuana stores being legally open where at the same time churches are shut down you have all these institutions and establishment bars stuff like that that they're legally allowed to be open during the corona virus but then you make it illegal or extremely burdensome economically for churches for the average church to be open because you what you've done is you've you've ordered an edict where you threatening people with serious jail time serious financial penalties if you dare defy the state and hold a church service now if you have a very large church or a mega church and you have the will to do it you can fight and and there are some brave people fighting but they have they have the resources and the numbers to to engage in a lengthy battle uh dr john mcarthur an excellent pastor here in southern california who i've interviewed uh on one of my radio shows and he's been a well-known christian leader for for decades and decades but i just read today uh i didn't read the whole thing it's 585 pages and macarthur a very respected bible teacher is suing the state of california starting with the government and then there's a whole list of names i mean the list of names is these are the people that run california so he's suing the government he's suing the governor by name he's suing the secretary of state he's suing all these key bureaucratic officials who who uh are part of a regime which has shut down all churches from operating unless they meet uh social distancing standards which are for an average church of regular size or even a large church the the list of uh things that you need need to do to comply to the law is basically impossible to meet you don't have that list when you go to the grocery store or if you go to a bar you don't have that list but you do have that list if you try to go to church or worship and so i'm looking at this 585 page lawsuit and trump's personal lawyer is helping to defend dr macarthur's church and he has a high power i think it's the thomas moore law center and some other very powerful lawyers have gotten together and they are waging a major major lawsuit against the state of california i mean it's huge this lawsuit that i was just glancing at 585 pages and this is a bold lawsuit this lawsuit is basically saying not only do you not have the right to shut down churches according to the constitution but he he isn't playing timid he said uh in the lawsuit not only do you not have the right to close down churches because that's against the constitution but he is requiring of them he's suing them he's requiring of them to make some kind of reparations for the fact that the church according to the constitution is actually supposed to give churches freedom of religion that's a higher level of rights and you're talking about things like freedom of speech freedom of religion freedom of the press those are a higher level of rights guaranteed to us by our constitution than many other areas you know whether you have a pot store or not that doesn't even that's not even ranking on unlike the constitution and it's not because they didn't have pot back then it's just it was not the founding fathers were concerned with the priorities so uh dr mark macarthur should be commended for his his brave stance because he's standing not just for himself and his church he's standing for every church in america whether you meet in your house or you have a small church or whatever he is he's defending those rights aggressively but it's interesting that the radical left which has penetrated uh and infected no unintended so many parts of our society like the the the leftist media with the mainstream media is one uniform note it's one leftist perspective and and much of government is from the leftist perspective and education from the leftist perspective and there's even a huge percentage of the evangelical church which which has succumbed to apostasy by rejecting biblical truth and accepting humanism to replace biblical truth so while dr macarthur is one of the most famous bible teachers and preachers in america while he is is uh doing uh something that that needs to be done he's being attacked by that by the i think he's the head the current head of the either was one of the current heads of the southern baptist denomination or he's he's high up maybe he's still head of the southern baptist baptist denomination his name is al i can't don't know if i can pronounce his last name right it's al mueller or al muller something like that now i know this guy because i've interviewed him in one of my radio programs basically to be blunt he's a cop out always has been a cop out if if you're challenged on the word of god this guy who was one of the heads of the southern uh southern baptist denominations mueller or whatever his name is he's always looked for a wiggle room i mean way back even when i interviewed him i could smell it always you know waffling on biblical truths always exercising not biblical leadership but exercising humanistic leadership is a sellout and uh if you're part of the southern baptist denomination you may have reasons for why you're there but i would just want to challenge many of you um if you think you can go to southern baptist church like arthur's church crying out loud maybe a southern baptist church i don't know but macarthur is sticking with the word of god so the issue isn't really the denomination it's just is that denomination or is that church in that denomination following the word of god and there's a huge percentage of southern baptist churches which are no longer following the word of god in all kinds of areas like i mentioned critical race theories is just one example so all of this is happening at the same time and when you see the imagery on television remember that television is perhaps the most powerful uh mind control propaganda brainwashing instrument in modern society that now in the internet and social media radio tv video social media all of them and and mainstream media especially is one of the most powerful means of mass mind control and when you look at it and you hear what they they say like the late night comedians who i i can't watch them i really i'm determined if the television set lands on that i mean i want a bar so bad it's incredible and they have this little mantra they say to each other you might know it i can't i can never remember it has something to do with like wear a mask wash your hands something else it's supposed to be cute it's not really cute it's very stupid but that's that's the level of their audience so uh when you look at the imagery not just hearing the words or looking at pictures regarding the coronavirus transmission wearing a mask social distancing quarantine etc etc when you take the time to study uh an esoteric subject like scientific mind control scientific social engineering propaganda brainwashing hypnotic programming you you see when you when you understand those fields of study and application then what you see on television is not just like a stroboscopic series of news images what you have to understand when you look at television or video or the mainstream medias especially mainstream media aol news it's all the same it's all a one big brother orwellian mind control thought police complex but when you understand the scientific principles of mind control mass mind control when you become educated on that subject you can walk into a room glance at a television set notice the people watching the news program or whatever or glance at somebody you know who's transfixed by their their social media or whatever and when you're trained in understanding not when i say trained i'm talking about you're going to have to self-educate yourself like like i did then you immediately notice things that other people in the room are oblivious to you you you you notice you know the reason why that on the debate platform there's such an emphasis on the mask how long somebody's wearing their mask what color a mask may be on somebody like and some people it'll be black and some people it'll be blue or white and the there was a philosopher occultist and a psychologist psychiatrist who was very famous dr carl young now obviously i don't agree probably with 90 percent of the theories of dr carl young but if you take any medical doctor let's say a medical doctor happens to be an atheist but let's say in a particular field this medical doctor knows more than anybody else his research has been has been checked out so are you going to dismiss him a hundred percent because you don't agree with his worldview no no because atheists humanists there are many areas in an atheistic humanist worldview uh which could be considered true or facts an example would be and i i've read you the bullet points of what the scientific method is if if contemporary scientists were were to truly be applying and using and adhering to the scientific method we'd have a revolution in our world first of all they threw out the theory of evolution because it's it's never past the scientific method the theory of evolution violates the scientific method so carl jung have been completely out there in many areas and and even have non-christian ideas which he did but that doesn't mean that in certain areas he didn't have his finger i don't think he completely understood it but he had his finger on uh a a truth and and when you compare it to god's word i would say he misses god's word but that doesn't mean there aren't isolated fields of study that somebody like carl young would come up with that may not be true true so he talked a lot about the collective unconscious that we were all plugged in and this was you know carl jung was around before cell phones and the whole thing he was carl young is way before the digital age so the but he postulated that we were all connected to some kind of energy or whatever the entire human race and so we have a collective uh unconscious now is that biblical well it's not that it's biblical or non-biblical it touches on an area which neuroscientists quantum physicists and others are are entering into and and most recently with the neurological studies and the studies of emf electromagnetic frequency just to review that truth with you um everything in in creation everything in the world every human being you every person you know your children your mother your father every single person and every single thing that it exists exists because it it is first uh an electromagnetic frequency so you and me and everybody you know we are all resonating 24 7 our own individual unique electromagnetic frequency range designed by god so just like your thumb print or your fingerprint is totally unique nobody else can have the same fingerprint that you have well nobody else on planet earth resonates the same precise electromagnetic frequency as you do so this was before he did not now young didn't understand this because the the electromagnetic frequencies were just starting to be studied back then but if if we are electromagnetic frequency beings which we are it has nothing to do with the bible we're still electromagnetic frequency beings and we generate a particular frequency so his theory was that deep inside our minds we share similar archetypical images uh uh visual themes auditory themes etc etc and that's about as far as he was able to go on it but you take the same thing when you look at sigmund freud sigmund freud the entire theory of psychoanalysis which many hollywood celebrities decades ago they would go get go go to their psychoanalyst you know for 10 20 30 years but nobody ever got cured and that's why psychoanalysis freud's psychoanalysis eventually fell from popularity because it never cured anybody people were going 10 20 30 years and they never got cured they just go into a maze and we look at sigmund freud's life and sigmund freud was not an atheist an occultist a highly immoral man a cocaine addict and a an expert on mind control and actually headed up one of the world's most premier mind control brainwashing social engineering institutions which is known as the tavistock institute and and the whole tavistock institute at one time when freud was the director in fact i believe they have a statue of sigmund freud on the outside they were all buzzed on cocaine and developing these theories on how to control the mass mine okay so people who work for the military-industrial complex high-level scientists in in every large superpower every nation like russia china the united states great britain et cetera et cetera they have huge divisions in their military that deal exclusively with with psyops psychological warfare mind control brainwashing propaganda etc it's a it's a major component in military warfare and you can brainwash an entire population to believe they're defeated and surrendered or you could use brainwashing in the reverse call it programming and you could program people to rise and not be defeated that's how powerful these mind technologies are so when you're looking at all the the images let's just talk about a bombardment of your mind endlessly with those stupid pictures of the coronavirus you know it's that circular sphere it looks like a planet and then you got these like tiny mushroom type uh shapes tiny mushroom shapes sticking out all over the sphere of of the coronavirus when you see it under a super microscope all right you're bombarding people through you through the visual senses you're saturating the consciousness and subconscious of people's minds with the image of sickness and death the coronavirus and let's remember although the the the notion of a subconscious is is looked at by some christians with great suspicion the reality is i don't think scientists have it accurate but to one degree or another we do have an inner man or an inner woman whether we call subconscious or your inner man or inner woman and and we have compartments in our being that doesn't mean you know your apostate because you believe that if you drink water you'll be hydrated that doesn't make you new age okay so the key thing to understand with mind control brainwashing hypnosis is you have basically two i'm simplifying it you have two areas of human consciousness are two areas of the human mind your conscious mind and your subconscious mind and then you have tears of consciousness or levels of consciousness within the subconscious and conscious modern mind control modern brainwashing hypnotic programming what it does is it may saturate a person's mind through audio through video through pictures through slogans through words it may saturate a person's mind with let's say verbal messages visual messages but these verbal and visual messages that you see in a movie or an episodic tv show or a mainstream news uh so-called news broadcast when you see these images and hear these sounds and see these symbols your conscious mind is perceiving them evaluate evaluating them and processing but without you even realizing it your subconscious mind which is which is massive your subconscious brain or your subconscious mind you're not aware of what it's doing but it's looking at the same composition of reality that your conscious mind is but your subconscious mind is processing the data and the information on a deep deep deep super super super intelligent manner and and that's how people go into hypnotic trances and hypnotic programming is because they don't understand their conscious mind hears one thing but their subconscious mind is able to open it up and connect it to other things that were deliberately embedded in somebody's mind so you have things like trigger mechanisms etc most people are completely unaware of this and therefore in their personal lives their children's lives and in the lives of a society we america is in a state a state of consciousness that could be described as a mild form of mind control and when you see these images being almost ceremonial ceremonially before you of the planet-like coronavirus with the mushroom shapes on it and the colors and and these rituals of the the sanitization of the hand and the mask and and standing six feet nine feet ten feet away or whatever and all the other things hey look i'm not saying that there isn't medical value in a lot of that there is medical value in a lot of that but it also makes for a tapestry where social engineers who are highly sophisticated can paint propaganda brainwashing and mind control they can literally like artists painted on the subconscious of your mind and your subconscious understands all kinds of things and processes all kinds of things that your conscious mind just doesn't get the way this shows up in everyday life is this the majority of business executives women and men they make very important decisions from their gut not their head their gut tells them to but what are they referring to their gut well we know that we have basically three brains okay you have the uh brain between your ears inside your skull where there's an entire array of of things and functions that the brain and your skull does and you then you have the brain in your heart and surrounding area and then you have the brain in your stomach area now and that's why so often people say i feel it in my gut i know it in my gut or you know i make decisions from my gut what they're saying really is that without making reference to it there's subconsciously no pun intended referring to the fact that they make their decisions not from their conscious mind primarily they're listening to their subconscious mind where the gut brain is and the proof that this is true is that the hundreds of millions of neurological pathways that contain memory that store experiences you've heard the expression muscle memory etc uh the subconscious mind stores all of that and the stomach area contains millions of neurological pathways that store information that trans information transmits information especially things like emotions unforgiveness bitterness anger rage those things get processed in the gut as well as other things and in the heart area you've heard that expression they died they were heartbroken that's why they died they had a heart attack their heart was broken and sometimes that refers to a marriage partner being unfaithful to someone and the spouse dies of a broken heart it shows up in the form of a heart attack or whatever but that's because the intense pain that they're feeling in their heart as the the emotion of loss of love is also the area where the neurological pathways process these emotions in the heart area so there's there's a close relationship between your biological self your spiritual self your neurological self and then of course in the world that we live in depending upon how you use your mind and how much you've developed your mind you can access perception platforms and other things which uh allow you to process information and make decisions by plugging into your subconscious or what the bible sometimes refers to as the spirit of a man or the spirit of a woman it's not talking about the holy spirit it's talking about the fact that every man or woman alive has a unique human spirit so the secular atheistic and occultic scientists like carl young sigmund freud and others that's what they were pumping their heads against this this subconscious mind it's just that because they were atheists they denied the bible and they denied the truth of the bible in which god says in numerous places in his word that we have the spirit of a man okay at that speaking in a manner that's uh synonymous with your subconscious it's not a perfect match but they're related but you will not be able to be free to understand what's going on to transcend confusion to see your plans materialize you won't even be able to really access all that god has put into you before the foundation of the world because you you were placed here in this time zone to accomplish a specific mission and purpose now i want to remind you that we are offering book bundles at paul mcguire.us where you can get four of my books in choose which titles you want four of my books in bundle discounts so you so you get a financial discount by buying a book bundle and you need to go to paul mcguire.us to take advantage of that that's paul mcguire.us since i started the program today the paul mcguire report i touched on so many things and so many of the things that i touched on i've written about in my books and i provide documentation and much greater detail so so in fact the book trump trump apocalypse which i wrote with uh troy anderson we talk this this book came out before well this book was written right about the time that trump became president and it came out a little bit afterwards but it predicted it predicts so many of the events in apocalypse predicts so many of the events that are happening now you know this whole thing about amendment 25 where they want to find a legal a quasi-legal fake legal reason to to impeach the president by declaring him insane or mentally unfit okay and they're serious about doing this now we wrote about this we warned about this strategy that they were going to use um that many major politicians are talking about we we wrote about this in drum pocalypse and that came out in january of 2018 and this a lot of this stuff that we wrote about lots of stuff that we wrote about that's happening now this coup against the president that's been going on we wrote about it before it happened so this is an excellent resource and then for brainwashing mind control and unplugging yourself from being programmed read conquering the matrix once again company matrix explains the principles that i just discussed with you and also how all of this connects to the world financial system and the goals of a powerful elite to bring about a one world government one world religion one world economic system and that's in conquering the matrix and then uh prophecy the future of america volume one or two where we talk about all kinds of things like the occult the occult and the entertainment business the occult and media uh what is going to happen in america in the near future we so in computer matrix that book is written by me paul mcguire and we have other uh across the future of america wanting one too where i talk in detail this was these were written some of these books were written like three years ago four years ago i talk in detail about riots in the streets race riots i mean this is not accidental when you read these books you will see hundreds of uh pieces and paragraphs and information that i give you where i accurately predict i'm not talking about predict like i'm the swami or some guru with a towel wrapped around his head i'm not talking about that talking about doing your homework doing research having documentation and then projecting what's going to happen and i projected the riots in the streets and the whole thing why because again once you know the game plan it's an easy read to figure it out this is the cloud pivot strategy the two columbia university professors who developed a marxist takeover mechanism mechanism where in the cloud pivot strategy the idea is to completely overwhelm the system like the riots the coronavirus the law enforcement dolphin you completely overwhelm the system so you can bring the system down and then implement your your socialist revolution i mean i've been writing about this for years and you know you have to understand it because if you don't understand it it's not going away tomorrow all of this stuff that that that you've been seeing hasn't even receded in the next few days and in the next few weeks depending upon how seriously god's people pray for our nation for the election um for our nation depending upon how seriously god's people pray in the next few days and weeks there is going to be a level of chaos a level of confusion it's going to be like the gates of hell were opened the level of lies propaganda attacks and the vast majority of them will have been pre-planned and orchestrated and you better prepare yourself for what i don't think most christians in america are even remotely prepared psychologically spiritually and mentally for what is about to happen in the next few days and weeks but i'll just tell you right now you need to be prepared spiritually intellectually practically or what is about to happen in the next few days and weeks here there's an all-out effort to overthrow the current system of america and replace it with a marxist socialist communist totalitarian state and you can't afford to be stupid that's why i always tell you educate yourself read books no because look anybody who knows anything about history knows what's coming next i i write about it my books for you i mean what more can i do anybody who knows anything about history knows what's going to come next because this model of revolution has been implemented and implemented and used in nation after nation over the last 125 years so you need to be prepared there's a reason has nothing to do with social distancing sanitization or effectively stopping the spread of the coronavirus the real purpose of some of these edicts and laws that are shutting down churches are keeping churches shut is to break the church why why would anybody want to break the church and this is where you have to be educated and educate your friends and it's hard and believe me i know it's hard you have to educate yourself and educate your friends and you have to understand the nature the true demonic nature communism marxism and socialism which i explained for you in a fast read in my book uh the greatest battle for the hearts and minds of mankind history the world you have to understand and explain it in the book things like this principles like this communism marxism socialism always advances through lies and deception and propaganda always they always sell people on a lie an illusion or workers paradise that never happens but the these are what you're seeing on television playing out before your eyes are strategies that were developed by social scientists by professors from the frankfurt school by time most people don't know that communist revolutions are almost methodical and scientific in their approach and they do different things to press levers and buttons and human emotions as i was sharing with you the other day they scientifically use envy as an energizing mechanism to create social chaos violence and bloody revolution so what's happening now is that we are now in an escalation stage the socialist marxist communist revolution which was seated in america in the 1800s okay especially around the time of the communist revolution in russia which was 1917. this was seated in america primarily through the educational system and all the marxist professors and i explained that whole story in my book the greatest battle for the hearts and minds of mankind history of the world that has been changing minds brainwashing minds tearing down christian beliefs tearing down capitalist beliefs tearing down nationalism tearing down uh belief in a traditional family tearing down uh any sense of immoral right and wrong and now it's escalating it's it's like somebody's pressing the accelerator faster that's why everything's happening with a great deal more intensity and it's being done openly right in your face with total defiance and total compliance by major political leaders major mayors of u.s cities are are empowering communist marxist revolutionaries to destroy our society just to buy a bunch of votes they'll sell out the entire nation but it's not just one political party in actuality it's both political parties so you need to become educated you need to be informed so that when you speak you're not on the defensive you know and you need to know what's gonna you need to understand what's happening the church with the exception of men like dr john macarthur the church and christians in america and christian churches especially bible believing ones we are already under attack and we are going to see a quantum increase in the intensity and level of attacks on the church on bible-believing christians and other christian institutions and and you have to really embrace the fact that that's not a fantasy it's true you have to remember one of the primary dogmas or maxims of communist marxist socialist revolutionary theory and that is they have beliefs just like christians have tenets and beliefs well communists marxists and socialists have tenets of belief and one of their primary tenets is by any means necessary in fact when you saw the president when you saw the vice presidential debate recently one of the two people debating openly used the term and kind of like owned up to yeah this is our strategy and this candidate for vice president actually said those marxist words by any means necessary so when they say by any means necessary christians and conservatives they they have a difficulty mentally processing the truth of the statement because that kind of behavior that immoral evil behavior is so repugnant to your average christian or conservative that they wouldn't dream of doing that themselves and so because they wouldn't dream of doing that themselves they have like a mental short circuit where they can't conceive that other people are more than willing to use murder violence assassination military overthrowing lying deceit when they say the words we're gonna have our revolution our communist marxist socialist revolution by any means necessary you gotta you gotta hit the brakes right there and think about what they're saying they're saying by any means necessary that means and they're not joking when they say that see christians and conservatives think oh this is those are just words no no they live by it they believe in terms of their doctrine that they are allowed to break any law of man any law of god they are allowed to conduct any immoral unethical evil action no matter how evil no matter how immoral no matter how spiritually dark a true communist socialist or marxist believes in the maxim by any means necessary so they don't have they don't they don't have guilt because they have erected their own ideology which gives them permission to do anything to commit adultery to murder somebody to to blow up their plane to to to give them some drug that'll make them go crazy to put them in a concentration camp you really really can't dodge this and this is where most christians this is the achilles heel this is where your back door is open this is where you're vulnerable and i'm trying to wake you up don't you understand what i've been doing on the radio for endless years i'm trying to wake people up that's what this is all about this this state of lethargy this mind control state this trance state added to a a demonic belief that you're entitled and allowed to do absolutely anything no matter how evil by any means necessary i'm trying to communicate to sleeping pastors sleeping christians in america especially because the deluge is about to come my friends they have given themselves total freedom total authority they don't abide by the constitution they don't even believe in the constitution they don't abide by the word of god they they mock the word of god but they will do anything just like adolf hitler would do anything and he was the national socialist and so when hitler and the nazis said they would do anything necessary and they did that meant killing in a concentration camp 30 million people jews and non-jews were were burnt to death and and killed in the gas chambers of nazi germany little children and women and men were experimented on by cruel sadistic scientists while they were awake with no anesthesia you know they had their eyeballs removed weird stuff man sadistically satanic stuff because they believe they're entitled to do it because they were the master race they didn't believe in god so when you ever whenever history gathers together men and women who start to believe that their god that they have the right to do anything they want simply because they have the power that they have the right to do anything they want by any means necessary you need to learn from history because what history tells you is that these people all of the people that i'm talking about these historical dictators they all wrote books they all wrote magazine articles or they were all interviewed or they all made public speeches there are actual documents where all these communist socialist leaders come right out in the open and admit that they're going to kill 25 million people by starving them to death or mass shootings and concentration camps the historical record says that in in every case of a significant communist type revolution the leaders like lenin and stalin and mao and others castro they all said what they were going to do so it wasn't like a secret the problem was is that people in western nations from a christian worldview from a conservative worldview have a moral code or at least they may not live up to it but they have a moral code and they can't fathom that anybody would actually do such evil and dark stuff but the whole lesson of history is when they say they're going to do it in their books their speeches and whatever you're supposed to pay attention because the historical norm is that they always announce what they're going to do publicly before they do it and the public the the historical lesson is pay attention to that because when you ignore it you're going to be overcome by it because it it always happens in the physical realm so hitler was open he wrote the book mein kampf where he said what he was going to do he talked about killing off the jews and everything else nobody believed them the jews didn't believe you know the jews were saying to themselves uh it can't happen here total denial well it was happening there and everything he wrote down and and nobody thought that any of these communist dictators could possibly be so evil that they would actually do these horror type things to to millions of people but they did they did and the whole lesson of history is when these people write it down and they say they're going to do it beware it's coming and it's coming very quickly i'm not trying to whip you into like some hyper paranoid state i'm just telling you based on history certain things are coming god has given his people in america and other places in the world god has given his people the option of not going down that road of destruction or choosing to go down the road of destruction god has given his people a choice but the choice the outcome of the choice is not measured in in vain repetitions the outcome of the choice that god's people in america are making right now will be visible to you by their behavior by their response to what's happening all around them and if they go into the mode i'm talking about christians if they go into the mode of retreatism hiding laying low that tells you they've opted for the historical pattern of just be quiet you know it'll go away just don't say anything lay low keep your mouth shut just go with the flow if that's the choice that christians in america are going to make then you can know with 100 certainty based on the historical precedence based on the earlier communist revolutions you can know for certainty that it's going to end up with concentration camps re-education camps mass killings mass murders i'm talking about millions of people dying and a total brutal hellish demonic totalitarian state i know that's a hard pill to swallow it's called truth i know it's a big pill to swallow most people don't want to swallow it it's called truth and it's not given to you to terrify you it's given to you to set you free to wake you up so that you can wake up others because if you really love people like you say you do then you're going to love others as you love yourself you're going to do everything you can to take to help god's people get back on the right road and recapture our nation and preserve our freedoms and our constitution and bill of rights which are directly connected to the bible the whole purpose of paul mcguire ministries in paradise mountain church is to teach people a biblical worldview and spread it through technology as far and wide as we possibly can as fast as we can to win people to jesus christ to our uh paradise mountain church meetings which we've had to suspend them we don't have a big facility we rent at a hotel they will not legally allow us uh to hold our meetings there because they would it would violate the uh laws of california in terms of social distancing sanitization and all kinds of things so if you own a large building and have a large parking lot you have a great deal more freedom but even then people are finding it next to impossible to comply with and notice that it's the church that's being targeted not you know marijuana stores or bars or other other places those are not considered important by a secular state so remember despite what they tell you in the mainstream media despite the lies you hear on cnn etc america was not created or founded to be a secular godless state america was founded on the truths of the bible and america was founded to be one nation under god and our founding fathers acknowledged openly and in the declaration of independence and in the bill of rights that all of our rights such as freedom of speech freedom of religion freedom of the press and all of the rights that we have are not given to us by government and government does not have the authority to either give us those rights or to take away those rights because our founding fathers said that it is only the creator capital c god almighty it's only the creator god almighty who has the power to give men and women all these rights like freedom of religion freedom of speech etc only god can give people those rights and only god uh has the power uh to take them away and the founding fathers were making a clear statement that the state or government does not have the right to to trample upon the church of jesus christ the bible the worship of jesus christ evangelism church meetings etc those rights cannot be even touched on by our government so why hasn't the supreme court i know this is those who you know a vote and everything going on we need to really pray for that but the point is if the republicans were doing the job why why are why why was that not addressed you have to watch these people like a hawk you're listening to the paul mcguire report this is paul mcguire spread these messages far and wide the internet automatically censors christian bible prophecy conservative thought nutritional information and the list keeps growing okay the only way you can get messages to go around internet censorship is for you to spread the links to our videos our audio our messages our website for you to spread spread it to the groups and your friends and groups that you belong to without your real willingness to spread these messages we're censored just like other people are it's all done by by bots and artificial intelligence it just searches for words and then it's censors and you'll notice that it's it's like right now any real truth about the coronavirus is all censored real medical information about the coronavirus is all censored so the only way to go around censorship is for you to spread and share things and so to partner with us if you believe in what we're doing uh spread this information and pray for us and then give financially with your contributions and donations as god tells you to obey the lord be in the spiritual battle because what drives this ministry is the burden of the holy spirit knowing that we do not reach uh the people that god has called us to reach quickly efficiently effectively we're going to lose our freedoms our nation this nation won't be worth living in for your children and grandchildren and the fate of other nations are largely continuing contingent on the leadership of america america is not some great you know super virtuous nation i'm not trying to say that but we lead the world in evil things and in good things and the world for the first time in a long long time has tasted a vision of freedom of prosperity of accountability of the government officials this is like it's like we've all been in a giant room for decades and finally somebody turned the lights on and we can see what's really been going on the incompetence the criminal theft the lying the deceit is staggering and ultimately the bible teaches us that we are in a spiritual war and we need to fight it both physical dimension a law-abiding peaceful manner in the dimension of the intellect and participation but also in the spiritual dimension it's a multi-dimensional warfare that's the whole reason for you being here on planet earth right now me being here on planet earth right now all reason for the existence of paradise mountain church and paul mcguire ministries the whole reason for all of it is that that it is in the plan of god that we do what we're called to do because god knew this day was coming before it came and so we have and others have been called to to do the things that god has called us to do in this time of difficulty and challenge we've been called to do this because we're in this last day spiritual battle jesus said occupy until i come and then when christ comes that will be the final victory over satan the antichrist the babylon world system one world government the one world religion the world one world economic system that system will be judged by jesus christ at his second coming so so this discussion moves on many levels and your ability to perceive your world reality is is based on your ability to see these different platforms and these different uh arenas of spiritual conflict that exist all around us and so you know in america christians have the opportunity to vote to speak out it's under attack but we still have the legal opportunity if you were in communist china they don't have the legal opportunity to do anything they're slaves totally they're tracked by computers uh chinese social credit score system and they live you live in a total dictatorship a true church is illegal freedom of religion is non-existent you get tortured shot killed i mean there are communist governments all over the world that have hundreds of millions of people in it but you don't ever hear much about it is because the corrupt uh mainstream media is hiding it from you and two um the powers that really run america and that run the world don't want you to see what's really going on because then they're scared that that if you see what's really going on in communist china you're scared that if you really see what's going on you might wake up and recognize hey gee the same thing that's going on in china it's starting to happen here you're afraid you might wake up and and put an end to their agenda and that's why we're in a time period where they're turning up the heat they're turning up to confusion they're turning up the chaos but you and i have been called by god supernaturally to be here for such a time as this you're listening to the paul mcguire report i'm paul mcguire spread this message far and wide pray for us give as god tells you to give and stand with us as we stand in the gap visit paul mcguire.us we'll be back in just a moment you are listening to the paul mcguire report this is paul mcguire it is very important for you to spread far and wide the messages that we give you so we can wake up our brothers and sisters in jesus christ so we can win people to jesus christ as their lord and savior you know one way to understand what's going on behind all the other things that are going on is to understand who and who the people are that are what you could call the globalist elite the heads of the international banking families plus the invisible elite that rule the world and this this system of the invisible occult elite that rules the world goes all the way back to ancient babylon um the babylonian system and i talked about that in my book a prophecy of the future of america volumes one and two conquering the matrix uh mass awakening and of course the new book the great the i can't even remember the names of the books the greatest battle for the hearts and minds of mankind in the history of the world deals with all of this okay so what's the game plan well god warned us about this because he judged ancient babylon at the time of the tower of babel it was the world's first new world order one world government one world religion one world economic system babylon at the time of the tower god came down and judged it because he saw the worship of lucifer in mankind's hearts but mystery babylon the secret occultic control system of the luciferian elite those who have given their souls to lucifer for power money whatever through secret societies occult secret societies have passed this occultic control system on um empire from empire to empire to our present world where we're on what we're seeing he warned about in the bible this new world order rising all around us and it will be the return of mystery babylon and you can read about it not only in genesis 11 but in the book of revelation god describes the return of mystery babylon and how god is going to judge it and we're at in the in that general time frame okay so what's the game plan of the united nations this one world government may be officially connected to the united nations or there may be some completely new name and new entity organizational entity that comes up the name of the organizational entity that's going to bring in mystery babylon or this one world system the name of it is not as important as the fact that it may change names but that this group is very much alive let me show you how it's alive so we have agenda 2030 and that's the united nations master plan which is the goal is to transform the world uh and create a one world government one world religion one world economic system and so the un agenda 2030 it primarily uses fears like a fear of climate change the fear of environmental catastrophe it uses the environment and green that's one of its main weapons to cause normally sane people to to cheerfully give up their homes their cars their electronics having a decent meal all that has to be sacrificed so you can live in an itsy-bitsy apartment uh and drive an itsy bitsy car or ride a bicycle or take public transportation you see the elite those who are uh ruling they're not going to give up a penny of their money and and those that take up uh managerial positions in this totalitarian regime they will have a higher standard of living just like it happens in communist countries so you see all these suckers and that's what they are they're suckers they're stupid when i was a kid in jackson heights queens in the streets of new york when somebody was a sucker you everybody knew that the person was a sucker because you could pull anything oh they were so stupid that they lacked the ability to perceive that they were being hoodwinked they were being taken advantage of so they were called stooges or suckers well most of the people blindly following globalism and the global order essentially are suckers and stooges because in every dictatorship where these principles have been applied there's no there's no you know redistribution of the wealth there's no social justice so the u.n lies okay and the secretary general of the u.n banking moon basically revealed to the world that agenda 2030 is is just a ploy uh to organize world leaders um and nations to join up with known uh criminal dictators evil evil men who run dictatorships like kim jong-un of north korea rual castro cuber cuba robert mugabe who massacred i don't know how many people would have massacred his troops massacred and yet they're they're equal decision makers with the united states in this agenda 2030 and what agenda 2030 really is is a road map to a global socialism a global marxism and a global corporatism as well as fascism now that sounds like it's contradictory but it's really not it's a global system designed for the benefit of the elite they don't give up anything they don't have small houses they don't have small cars their wealth will continue to grow uh on the level of obscenity they will get richer and richer and richer this is not designed uh to be the fulfillment of john lennon's dream imagine there's no heaven imagine there's no money and all the rest of this stuff so the part the real purpose of agenda 2030 is to get people all over the world especially the middle class and the working class to reduce their consumption uh to to lower their standard of living to reduce their lifestyle to to get rid of the middle class to get rid of any possibility of the average person person starting at the bottom and working his way or working her way up the whole thing agenda 2030 is designed to destroy things like the suburbs to destroy rural areas and force everybody to live in microscopic apartments in quote smart cities there won't be any police in smart cities because it'll be you'll be controlled by artificial intelligence and ships and other technologies so this pandemic based on a virus or whatever they determine it is the real reason for it is to bring agenda 2030 into realization and we have a lot of big uh political figures in the united states who they don't owe their allegiance to the united states to the constitution or the bill of rights they are in bed with the globalist elite and the un agenda 2030. this is all part of the game plan and if you want to see a living example of the game plan just look at the dictators that rule communist china and communist china is is very connected to the united nations and is very connected to reordering the goals of the un so what you basically have is the chinese communist dictators formulating what the the layout of un agenda 2030 is going to be like now let's remember in in the communist nation of china you have a brutal dictatorship you have forced abortions you have total censorship you have complete religious and political persecution and they implement the one child policy which means every uh family is allowed to have one child so guess what if you get pregnant you have to have an abortion because you're only allowed one child now you may ask yourself with all the egregious things that the communist chinese dictatorship does how come mainstream news never covers it because they don't want you to know and then what they don't want you to know is that they're transforming america into the same thing that's the reason they don't want you to see it don't really know what it's about that they brainwashed the kids in into thinking that they're helping climate change it has nothing to do with climate change it has to do with the global dictatorship totalitarian regime and then ask yourself the question that the big search engine companies um and the mega corporations and and the top three search engine companies like google microsoft being yahoo um are they supporting to censorship the u.n agenda 2030 it looks like they are so you have a conflict here because on one hand you have the biblically based christian based real life foundation historical foundation in the united states all of our freedoms our governmental structure in the united states is built on biblical principles and we are given freedom of religion freedom of the press uh freedom of speech and many other freedoms and the foundation of of the of freedom of prosperity of the american dream of your rights the foundation of that ideas have consequences comes from the ideas that the pilgrims and puritans received from studying the bible so it's biblical truths that created the foundation upon which all of our freedoms and prosperity have come from and so the people that are in allegiance to godlessness and totalitarianism they hate the freedoms because they want everybody to believe the same thing it's in john lennon's song imagine there's no heaven now that all the rest of the lyrics that's what they want people to believe they want to believe they want people to be so brainwashed that they actually believe as many do that truth can be found in the lyrics of john lennon's song imagine see the get the game is to it's what's beneath the surface of all of it is the spiritual truths that the bible reveals everything from the coming of babylon in genesis 11 bible prophecy being filled especially in the book of revelation but the bible tells us that paradise was available to mankind in the garden of eden with adam and eve when adam and eve disobeyed god's word and listened to the devil serpent of old they lost paradise and what is it that communism promises people a worker's paradise it never delivers the workers paradise the only time mankind was given paradise until mankind blew it was in the garden of eden but you don't hear this preached in any churches because they don't study the bible they have no biblical worldview but when you read what happens after jesus christ returns he he burns up the old earth the old heavens and he brings in the new heaven the new earth from new jerusalem he brings in paradise he restores paradise it's simply called heaven you'll have a brand new glorified body that world the new earth and the new heaven will be perfect it will be beautiful there'll be no evil of any kind in that world because that world will be ruled by truth jesus christ is king of kings and lord of lords he will rule with his people for all eternity evil will not be allowed this is the war that we're seeing is the last stand of evil before the second coming of jesus christ you and i are not supposed to be passive and just like daydreaming up until the return of the lord we're to be occupying the land until jesus christ counts god bless you this is your brother in christ paul mcguire
